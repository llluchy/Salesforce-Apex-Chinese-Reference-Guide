## Calculate Trigger

```apex

// Use a map because it doesn't allow duplicate values

MapID, Shipping_Invoice__C> updateMap = new MapID, Shipping_Invoice__C>();

// Set this integer to -1 if we are deleting
Integer subtract ;

// Populate the list of items based on trigger type
List itemList;
    if(trigger.isInsert || trigger.isUpdate){
        itemList = Trigger.new;
        subtract = 1;
    }
    else if(trigger.isDelete)
    {
        // Note -- there is no trigger.new in delete
        itemList = trigger.old;
        subtract = -1;
    }

// Access all the information we need in a single query 
// rather than querying when we need it.
// This is a best practice for bulkifying requests

set AllItems = new set();

// Assert numbers are not negative.  
// None of the fields would make sense with a negative value

System.assert(i.quantity__c > 0, 'Quantity must be positive');
