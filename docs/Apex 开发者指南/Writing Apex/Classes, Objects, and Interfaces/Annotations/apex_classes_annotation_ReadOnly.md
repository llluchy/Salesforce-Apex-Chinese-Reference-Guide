# ReadOnly Annotation

The `@ReadOnly` annotation allows you to perform less restrictive queries against the Lightning Platform database by increasing the limit of the number of returned rows for a request to 1,000,000. All other limits still apply. The annotation blocks the following operations within the request: DML operations, calls to `System.schedule`, and enqueued asynchronous Apex jobs.

The `@ReadOnly` annotation is available for REST and SOAP Web services and the `Schedulable` interface. To use the `@ReadOnly` annotation, the top-level request must be in the schedule execution or the Web service invocation. For example, if a Visualforce page calls a Web service that contains the `@ReadOnly` annotation, the request fails because Visualforce is the top-level request, not the Web service.

Visualforce pages can call controller methods with the `@ReadOnly` annotation, and those methods run with the same relaxed restrictions. To increase other Visualforce-specific limits, such as the size of a collection that can be used by an iteration component like `<apex:pageBlockTable>`, you can set the `readonly` attribute on the `<apex:page>` tag to `true`. For more information, see [Working with Large Sets of Data](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.pages.meta/pages/pages_controller_readonly_context.htm "HTML (New Window)") in the *[Visualforce Developer's Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.pages.meta/pages/ "HTML (New Window)")*.

## Versioned Behavior Changes

Prior to API version 49.0, using `@ReadOnly` on Apex REST methods (@HttpDelete, @HttpGet, @HttpPatch, @HttpPost, or @HttpPut) also required annotating the method with `@RemoteAction`. In API version 49.0 and later, you can annotate Apex REST methods with just `@ReadOnly`.
