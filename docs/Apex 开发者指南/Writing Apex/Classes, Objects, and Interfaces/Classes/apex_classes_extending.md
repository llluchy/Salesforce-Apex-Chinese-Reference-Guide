# Extending a Class

You can extend a class to provide more specialized behavior.

A class that extends another class inherits all the methods and properties of the extended class. In addition, the extending class can override the existing virtual methods by using the override keyword in the method definition. Overriding a virtual method allows you to provide a different implementation for an existing method. This means that the behavior of a particular method is different based on the object you’re calling it on. This is referred to as polymorphism.

A class extends another class using the `extends` keyword in the class definition. A class can only extend one other class, but it can implement more than one interface.

This example shows how the `YellowMarker` class extends the `Marker` class. To run the inheritance examples in this section, first create the `Marker` class.

```apex
public virtual class Marker {
    public virtual void write() {
        System.debug('Writing some text.');
    }

    public virtual Double discount() {
        return .05;
    }
}
```

Then create the `YellowMarker` class, which extends the `Marker` class.

```apex
// Extension for the Marker class
public class YellowMarker extends Marker {
    public override void write() {
        System.debug('Writing some text using the yellow marker.');
    } 
}
```

This code segment shows polymorphism. The example declares two objects of the same type (`Marker`). Even though both objects are markers, the second object is assigned to an instance of the `YellowMarker` class. Hence, calling the `write` method on it yields a different result than calling this method on the first object, because this method has been overridden. However, you can call the `discount` method on the second object even though this method isn't part of the `YellowMarker` class definition. But it’s part of the extended class, and hence, is available to the extending class, `YellowMarker`. Run this snippet in the Execute Anonymous window of the Developer Console.

```apex
Marker obj1, obj2;
obj1 = new Marker();
// This outputs 'Writing some text.'
obj1.write();

obj2 = new YellowMarker();
// This outputs 'Writing some text using the yellow marker.'
obj2.write();
// We get the discount method for free
// and can call it from the YellowMarker instance.
Double d = obj2.discount();
```

The extending class can have more method definitions that aren't common with the original extended class. In this example, the `RedMarker` class extends the `Marker` class and has one extra method, `computePrice`, that isn't available for the `Marker` class. To call the extra methods, the object type must be the extending class.

Before running the next snippet, create the `RedMarker` class, which requires the `Marker` class in your org.

```apex
// Extension for the Marker class
public class RedMarker extends Marker {
    public override void write() {
        System.debug('Writing some text in red.');
    } 

    // Method only in this class
    public Double computePrice() {
        return 1.5;
    }
}
```

This snippet shows how to call the additional method on the `RedMarker` class. Run this snippet in the Execute Anonymous window of the Developer Console.

```apex
RedMarker obj = new RedMarker();
// Call method specific to RedMarker only
Double price = obj.computePrice();
```

Extensions also apply to interfaces—an interface can extend another interface. As with classes, when an interface extends another interface, all the methods and properties of the extended interface are available to the extending interface.

## Versioned Behavior Changes

In API version 65.0 and later, an abstract or override method requires a `protected`, `public`, or `global` access modifier. If one of these access modifiers isn’t explicitly included in the method declaration, then method access defaults to `private`. Private access is invalid for these method types because the implementing class can’t access the abstract method. Therefore, if you attempt to declare an abstract or override method without an allowed access modifier, you get the compilation error `Abstract methods require at least one of the following: global, public, protected`.

In API version 50.0 and later, scope and accessibility rules are enforced on Apex variables, methods, inner classes, and interfaces that are annotated with `@namespaceAccessible`. For accessibility considerations, see [NamespaceAccessible Annotation](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_annotation_NamespaceAccessible.htm). For more information on namespace-based visibility, see [Namespace-Based Visibility for Apex Classes in Second-Generation Packages](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_unlocked_namespace_visibility.htm "HTML (New Window)").
