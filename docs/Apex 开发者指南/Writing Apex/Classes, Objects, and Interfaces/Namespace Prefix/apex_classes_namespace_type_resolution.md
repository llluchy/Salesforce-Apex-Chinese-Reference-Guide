# Type Resolution and System Namespace for Types

Because the type system must resolve user-defined types defined locally or in other classes, the Apex parser evaluates types as follows:

1.  For a type reference `TypeN`, the parser first looks up that type as a scalar type.
2.  If `TypeN` is not found, the parser looks up locally defined types.
3.  If `TypeN` still is not found, the parser looks up a class of that name.
4.  If `TypeN` still is not found, the parser looks up system types such as sObjects.

For the type `T1.T2` this could mean an inner type `T2` in a top-level class `T1`, or it could mean a top-level class `T2` in the namespace `T1` (in that order of precedence).
