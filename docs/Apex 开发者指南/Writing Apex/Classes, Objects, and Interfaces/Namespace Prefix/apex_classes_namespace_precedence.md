# Namespace, Class, and Variable Name Precedence

Because local variables, class names, and namespaces can all hypothetically use the same identifiers, the Apex parser evaluates expressions in the form of `name1.name2.[...].nameN` as follows:

1.  The parser first assumes that `name1` is a local variable with `name2` - `nameN` as field references.
2.  If the first assumption does not hold true, the parser then assumes that `name1` is a class name and `name2` is a static variable name with `name3` - `nameN` as field references.
3.  If the second assumption does not hold true, the parser then assumes that `name1` is a namespace name, `name2` is a class name, `name3` is a static variable name, and `name4` - `nameN` are field references.
4.  If the third assumption does not hold true, the parser reports an error.

If the expression ends with a set of parentheses (for example, `name1.name2.[...].nameM.nameN()`), the Apex parser evaluates the expression as follows:

1.  The parser first assumes that `name1` is a local variable with `name2` - `nameM` as field references, and `nameN` as a method invocation.
2.  If the first assumption does not hold true:
    -   If the expression contains only two identifiers (`name1.name2()`), the parser then assumes that `name1` is a class name and `name2` is a method invocation.
    -   If the expression contains more than two identifiers, the parser then assumes that `name1` is a class name, `name2` is a static variable name with `name3` - `nameM` as field references, and `nameN` is a method invocation.
3.  If the second assumption does not hold true, the parser then assumes that `name1` is a namespace name, `name2` is a class name, `name3` is a static variable name, `name4` - `nameM` are field references, and `nameN` is a method invocation.
4.  If the third assumption does not hold true, the parser reports an error.

However, with class variables Apex also uses dot notation to reference member variables. Those member variables might refer to other class instances, or they might refer to an sObject which has its own dot notation rules to refer to field names (possibly navigating foreign keys).

Once you enter an sObject field in the expression, the remainder of the expression stays within the sObject domain, that is, sObject fields cannot refer back to Apex expressions.

For instance, if you have the following class:

```apex
public class c { 
  c1 c1 = new c1(); 
  class c1 { c2 c2; } 
  class c2 { Account a; } 
}
```

Then the following expressions are all legal:

```apex
c.c1.c2.a.name
c.c1.c2.a.owner.lastName.toLowerCase()
c.c1.c2.a.tasks
c.c1.c2.a.contacts.size()
```
