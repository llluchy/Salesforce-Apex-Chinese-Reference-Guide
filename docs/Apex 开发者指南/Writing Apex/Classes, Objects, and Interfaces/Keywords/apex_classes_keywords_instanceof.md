# Using the instanceof Keyword

If you need to verify at run time whether an object is actually an instance of a particular class, use the `instanceof` keyword. The `instanceof` keyword can only be used to verify if the target type in the expression on the right of the keyword is a viable alternative for the declared type of the expression on the left.

You could add the following check to the `Report` class in the [classes and casting example](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_casting.htm "In general, all type information is available at run time. This means that Apex enables casting, that is, a data type of one class can be assigned to a data type of another class, but only if one class is a subclass of the other class. Use casting when you want to convert an object from one data type to another.") before you cast the item back into a `CustomReport` object.

```apex
if (Reports.get(0) instanceof CustomReport) {
    // Can safely cast it back to a custom report object
   CustomReport c = (CustomReport) Reports.get(0);
   } else {
   // Do something with the non-custom-report.
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

Keep these considerations in mind while using the `instanceof` keyword.

-   If the declared type on the left of the expression using the `instanceof` keyword is always an instance of the target type, compilation fails. An example expression that’s always true and therefore causes a compilation error.

```plain
Account acc = new Account();
if(acc instanceOf Account) {
     //condition is always true since an instance of Account is always an instance of Account
}
```

-   When you perform `instanceof` checks, implicit type casting from String to ID can result in unexpected behavior if the String meets the requirements to be cast to an ID.

## Versioned Behavior Changes

In API version 60.0 and later, if a `List` data type implements the `Iterable` data type, compilation fails. An example `instanceof` expression that causes a compilation error.

```plain
public class BaseClass {}
public class SubClass extends BaseClass {}

List subClasses = new List();
if(subClasses instanceof Iterable) {
    //condition is always true since an instance of SubClass is always an instance of BaseClass
}
```

In API version 32.0 and later, `instanceof` returns `false` if the left operand is a null object. In API version 31.0 and earlier, `instanceof` returns true in this case. For example, the code sample returns `false` in API version 32.0 and later.

```apex
Object o = null;
Boolean result = o instanceof Account;
System.assertEquals(false, result);
```
