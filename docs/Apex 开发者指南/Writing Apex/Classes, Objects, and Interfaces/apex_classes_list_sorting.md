# Lists of Custom Types and Sorting

Lists can hold objects of your user-defined types (your Apex classes). Lists of user-defined types can be sorted.

To sort such a list, your Apex class can implement the `Comparator` interface and pass it as a parameter to the `List.sort` method. Alternatively, your Apex class can implement the `Comparable` interface.

The sort criteria and sort order depend on the implementation that you provide for the `Comparable.compareTo` or the `Comparator.compare` method.

To perform locale-sensitive comparisons and sorting, use the `Collator` class. Because locale-sensitive sorting can produce different results depending on the user running the code, avoid using it in triggers or in code that expects a particular sort order.
