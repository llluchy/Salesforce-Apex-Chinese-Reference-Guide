# Deleting Records

After you persist records in the database, you can delete those records using the `delete` operation. Deleted records aren’t deleted permanently from Salesforce, but they are placed in the Recycle Bin for 15 days from where they can be restored. Restoring deleted records is covered in a later section.

## Example

The following example deletes all accounts that are named 'DotCom':

```apex
Account[] doomedAccts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account 
                         WHERE Name = 'DotCom']; 
try {
    delete doomedAccts;
} catch (DmlException e) {
    // Process exception here
}
```

 

:::tip Note
For more information on processing `DmlException`s, see [Bulk DML Exception Handling](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dml_bulk_exceptions.htm).

## Referential Integrity When Deleting and Restoring Records

The `delete` operation supports cascading deletions. If you delete a parent object, you delete its children automatically, as long as each child record can be deleted.

For example, if you delete a case record, Apex automatically deletes any CaseComment, CaseHistory, and CaseSolution records associated with that case. However, if a particular child record is not deletable or is currently being used, then the `delete` operation on the parent case record fails.

The `undelete` operation restores the record associations for the following types of relationships:

-   Parent accounts (as specified in the Parent Account field on an account)
-   Indirect account-contact relationships (as specified on the Related Accounts related list on a contact or the Related Contacts related list on an account)
-   Parent cases (as specified in the Parent Case field on a case)
-   Master solutions for translated solutions (as specified in the Master Solution field on a solution)
-   Managers of contacts (as specified in the Reports To field on a contact)
-   Products related to assets (as specified in the Product field on an asset)
-   Opportunities related to quotes (as specified in the Opportunity field on a quote)
-   All custom lookup relationships
-   Relationship group members on accounts and relationship groups, with some exceptions
-   Tags
-   An article's categories, publication state, and assignments

:::tip Note
Salesforce
                only restores lookup relationships that have not been replaced. For example, if an
                asset is related to a different product prior to the original product record being
                undeleted, that asset-product relationship is not restored.
