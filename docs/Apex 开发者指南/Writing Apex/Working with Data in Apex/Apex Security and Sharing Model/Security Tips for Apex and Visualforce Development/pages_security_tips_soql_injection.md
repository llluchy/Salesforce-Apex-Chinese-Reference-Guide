# SOQL Injection

In other programming languages, the previous flaw is known as SQL injection. Apex doesn’t use SQL, but uses its own database query language, SOQL. SOQL is simpler and more limited in functionality than SQL. The risks are lower for SOQL injection than for SQL injection, but the attacks are nearly identical to traditional SQL injection. SQL/SOQL injection takes user-supplied input and uses those values in a dynamic SOQL query. If the input isn’t validated, it can include SOQL commands that effectively modify the SOQL statement and trick the application into performing unintended commands.

## SOQL Injection Vulnerability in Apex

Here’s a simple example of Apex and Visualforce code vulnerable to SOQL injection.

```apex
controller="SOQLController" >
    >
         value="Enter Name" />
         value="{!name}" />
         value="Query" action="{!query}“ />
    >
>
public class SOQLController {
    public String name {
        get { return name;}
        set { name = value;}
    } 
    public PageReference query() {
        String qryString = 'SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE ' +
            '(IsDeleted = false and Name like \'%' + name + '%\')';
        List> queryResult = Database.query(qryString);
        System.debug('query result is ' + queryResult);
        return null;
    }
}
```

This simple example illustrates the logic. The code is intended to search for contacts that weren’t deleted. The user provides one input value called `name`. The value can be anything provided by the user, and it’s never validated. The SOQL query is built dynamically and then executed with the `Database.query` method. If the user provides a legitimate value, the statement executes as expected.

```plain
// User supplied value: name = Bob 
// Query string
SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE (IsDeleted = false and Name like '%Bob%')
```

But what if the user provides unexpected input, such as:

```plain
// User supplied value for name: test%') OR (Name LIKE '
```

 In that case, the query string becomes:

```plain
SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE (IsDeleted = false AND Name LIKE '%test%') OR (Name LIKE '%')
```

Now the results show all contacts, not just the non-deleted ones. A SOQL Injection flaw can be used to modify the intended logic of any vulnerable query.

## SOQL Injection Defenses

To prevent a SOQL injection attack, avoid using dynamic SOQL queries. Instead, use static queries and binding variables. The preceding vulnerable example can be rewritten using static SOQL.

```apex
public class SOQLController { 
    public String name { 
        get { return name;} 
        set { name = value;} 
    } 
    public PageReference query() { 
        String queryName = '%' + name + '%';
        List queryResult = [SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE 
           (IsDeleted = false and Name like :queryName)];
        System.debug('query result is ' + queryResult);
        return null; 
    } 
}
```

If you must use dynamic SOQL, use the `escapeSingleQuotes` method to sanitize user-supplied input. This method adds the escape character (\\) to all single quotation marks in a string that is passed in from a user. The method ensures that all single quotation marks are treated as enclosing strings, instead of database commands.
