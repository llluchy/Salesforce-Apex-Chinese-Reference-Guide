# Dynamic SOQL

**Dynamic SOQL** refers to the creation of a SOQL string at run time with Apex code. Dynamic SOQL enables you to create more flexible applications. For example, you can create a search based on input from an end user or update records with varying field names.

To create a dynamic SOQL query at run time, use the `Database.query` or `Database.queryWithBinds` methods, in one of the following ways.

-   Return a single sObject when the query returns a single record:

```apex
sObject s = Database.query(string);
```

-   Return a list of sObjects when the query returns more than a single record:

```apex
List sobjList = Database.query(string);
```

-   Return a list of sObjects using a map of bind variables:

```apex
List sobjList = Database.queryWithBinds(string, bindVariablesMap, accessLevel);
```

The `Database.query` and `Database.queryWithBinds` methods can be used wherever an inline SOQL query can be used, such as in regular assignment statements and `for` loops. The results are processed in much the same way as static SOQL queries are processed.

In API version 55.0 and later, you can use the accessLevel parameter to run the query operation in user or system mode. The accessLevel parameter specifies whether the method runs in system mode (`AccessLevel.SYSTEM_MODE`) or user mode (`AccessLevel.USER_MODE`). In system mode, the object and field-level permissions of the current user are ignored, and the record sharing rules are controlled by the [class sharing keywords](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_keywords_sharing.htm). In user mode, the object permissions, field-level security, and sharing rules of the current user are enforced. User mode is the default.

Dynamic SOQL results can be specified as concrete sObjects, such as Account or MyCustomObject\_\_c, or as the generic sObject data type. At run time, the system validates that the type of the query matches the declared type of the variable. If the query doesn’t return the correct sObject type, a run-time error is thrown. Therefore, you don’t have to cast from a generic sObject to a concrete sObject.

Dynamic SOQL queries have the same governor limits as static queries. For more information on governor limits, see [Execution Governors and Limits](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_gov_limits.htm "Because Apex runs in a multitenant environment, the Apex runtime engine strictly enforces limits so that runaway Apex code or processes don’t monopolize shared resources. If some Apex code exceeds a limit, the associated governor issues a runtime exception that can’t be handled.").

For a full description of SOQL query syntax, see [Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm "html (New Window)") in the *SOQL and SOSL Reference.*

## Dynamic SOQL Considerations

You can use simple bind variables in dynamic SOQL query strings when using `Database.query`. Bind variables in the query must be within the scope of the database operation. The following is allowed:

```apex
String myTestString = 'TestName';
List sobjList = Database.query('SELECT Id FROM MyCustomObject__c WHERE Name = :myTestString', AccessLevel.USER_MODE);
```

 However, unlike inline SOQL, you can’t use bind variable fields in the query string with `Database.query`. The following example isn’t supported and results in a `Variable does not exist` error.

```apex
MyCustomObject__c myVariable = new MyCustomObject__c(field1__c ='TestField');
List sobjList = Database.query('SELECT Id FROM MyCustomObject__c WHERE field1__c = :myVariable.field1__c', AccessLevel.USER_MODE);
```

 You can instead resolve the variable field into a string and use the string in your dynamic SOQL query:

```apex
String resolvedField1 = myVariable.field1__c;
List sobjList = Database.query('SELECT Id FROM MyCustomObject__c WHERE field1__c =  :resolvedField1', AccessLevel.USER_MODE);
```

(API version 57.0 and later) Another option is to use the `Database.queryWithBinds` method. With this method, bind variables in the query are resolved from a Map parameter directly with a key, rather than from Apex code variables. This removes the need for the variables to be in scope when the query is executed. This example shows a SOQL query that uses a bind variable for an Account name; its value is passed in with the acctBinds Map.

```apex
MapString, Object> acctBinds = new MapString, Object>{'acctName' => 'Acme Corporation'};

List accts = 
    Database.queryWithBinds('SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name = :acctName',
                            acctBinds, 
                            AccessLevel.USER_MODE);
```

These considerations apply when using the Map parameter in the `Database.queryWithBinds` method:

-   Although map keys of type String are case-sensitive,the `queryWithBinds` method doesn’t support Map keys that differ only in case. In a `queryWithBinds` method, comparison of Map keys is case-insensitive. If duplicate Map keys exist, the method throws a runtime `QueryException`. This example throws this runtime exception: `System.QueryException: The bindMap consists of duplicate case-insensitive keys: \[Acctname, acctName\]`. 

```apex
MapString, Object> bindVars = new MapString, Object>{'acctName' => 'Acme Corporation'};
bindVars.put('Acctname', 'Foo');
string query = 'SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE Name LIKE :acctName';
 
List contacts =  Database.queryWithBinds(query, bindVars, AccessLevel.USER_MODE);
```

-   Map keys must follow naming standards: they must start with an ASCII letter, can’t start with a number, must not use [reserved keywords](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_reserved_words.htm "These words can be used only as keywords."), and must adhere to [variable naming requirements](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/langCon_apex_variables.htm "Local variables are declared with Java-style syntax.").
-   Although currently supported, Salesforce recommends against using the dot notation with Map keys.

## SOQL Injection

**SOQL injection** is a technique by which a user causes your application to execute database methods you didn’t intend by passing SOQL statements into your code. This can occur in Apex code whenever your application relies on end-user input to construct a dynamic SOQL statement and you don’t handle the input properly.

To prevent SOQL injection, use the `escapeSingleQuotes` method. This method adds the escape character (\\) to all single quotation marks in a string that is passed in from a user. The method ensures that all single quotation marks are treated as enclosing strings, instead of database commands.

## Additional Dynamic SOQL Methods

The Dynamic SOQL examples in this topic show how to use the `Database.query` and `Database.queryWithBinds` methods. These methods also use Dynamic SOQL:

-   `Database.countQuery` and `Database.countQueryWithBinds`: Return the number of records that a dynamic SOQL query would return when executed.
-   `Database.getQueryLocator` and `Database.getQueryLocatorWithBinds`: Create a `QueryLocator` object used in batch Apex or Visualforce.
