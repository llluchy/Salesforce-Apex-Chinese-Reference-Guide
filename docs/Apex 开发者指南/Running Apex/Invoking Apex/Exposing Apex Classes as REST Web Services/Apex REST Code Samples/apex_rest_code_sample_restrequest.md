# Apex REST Code Sample Using RestRequest

This sample shows you how to add an attachment to a record by using the RestRequest object.

For more information about authenticating with `cURL`, see the [Quick Start](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.api_rest.meta/api_rest/quickstart.htm "HTML (New Window)") section of the *REST API Developer Guide*. In this code, the binary file data is stored in the RestRequest object, and the Apex service class accesses the binary data in the RestRequest object .

1.  Create an Apex class in your org from Setup by entering Apex Classes in the Quick Find box, then selecting **Apex Classes**. Click **New** and add the following code to your new class:

```apex
@RestResource(urlMapping='/CaseManagement/v1/*')
global with sharing class CaseMgmtService
{

    @HttpPost
    global static String attachPic(){
        RestRequest req = RestContext.request;
        RestResponse res = Restcontext.response;
        Id caseId = req.requestURI.substring(req.requestURI.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
        Blob picture = req.requestBody;
        Attachment a = new Attachment (ParentId = caseId,
                                       Body = picture,
                                       ContentType = 'image/jpg',
                                       Name = 'VehiclePicture');
        insert a;
        return a.Id;
   }
}
```

2.  Open a command-line window and execute the following `cURL` command to upload the attachment to a case:
    
    `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sessionId" -H "X-PrettyPrint: 1" -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" --data-binary @file "https://MyDomainName.my.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/CaseManagement/v1/caseId"`
    
    -   Replace **sessionId** with the `<sessionId>` element that you noted in the login response.
    -   Replace **MyDomainName** with the My Domain name for your org.
    -   Replace **caseId** with the ID of the case you want to add the attachment to.
    -   Replace **file** with the path and file name of the file you want to attach.
    
    Your command should look something like this (with the **sessionId** replaced with your session ID and MyDomainName replaced with the My Domain Name for your org):
    
    

```plain
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sessionId" 
-H "X-PrettyPrint: 1" -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" --data-binary @c:\test\vehiclephoto1.jpg 
"https://MyDomainName.my.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/CaseManagement/v1/500D0000003aCts"
```

 

:::tip Note
The `cURL` examples in this
                        section don’t use a namespaced Apex class so you won’t see the namespace in
                        the URL.
:::

The Apex class returns a JSON response that contains the attachment ID such as the following:

```plain
"00PD0000001y7BfMAI"
```

-   To verify that the attachment and the image were added to the case, navigate to **Cases** and select the **All Open Cases** view. Click on the case and then scroll down to the Attachments related list. You should see the attachment you just created.
