# Trigger Exceptions

Triggers can be used to prevent DML operations from occurring by calling the `addError()` method on a record or field. When used on `Trigger.new` records in `insert` and `update` triggers, and on `Trigger.old` records in `delete` triggers, the custom error message is displayed in the application interface and logged.

:::tip Note
Users experience less of a delay in response time if errors are added to `before` triggers.
:::

A subset of the records being processed can be marked with the `addError()` method:

-   If the trigger was spawned by a DML statement in Apex, any one error results in the entire operation rolling back. However, the runtime engine still processes every record in the operation to compile a comprehensive list of errors.
-   If the trigger was spawned by a bulk DML call in the Lightning Platform API, the runtime engine sets aside the bad records and attempts to do a partial save of the records that did not generate errors. See [Bulk DML Exception Handling](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dml_bulk_exceptions.htm).

If a trigger ever throws an unhandled exception, all records are marked with an error and no further processing takes place.
