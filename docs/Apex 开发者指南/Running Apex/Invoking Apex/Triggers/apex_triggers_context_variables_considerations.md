# Context Variable Considerations

Be aware of the following considerations for trigger context variables:

-   `trigger.new` and `trigger.old` cannot be used in Apex DML operations.
-   You can use an object to change its own field values using `trigger.new`, but only in before triggers. In all after triggers, `trigger.new` is not saved, so a runtime exception is thrown.
-   `trigger.old` is always read-only.
-   You cannot delete `trigger.new`.

The following table lists considerations about certain actions in different trigger events:

| Trigger Event | Can change fields using `trigger.new` | Can update original object using an update DML operation | Can delete original object using a delete DML operation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `before insert` | Allowed. | Not applicable. The original object has not been created; nothing can reference it, so nothing can update it. | Not applicable. The original object has not been created; nothing can reference it, so nothing can update it. |
| `after insert` | Not allowed. A runtime error is thrown, as `trigger.new` is already saved. | Allowed. | Allowed, but unnecessary. The object is deleted immediately after being inserted. |
| `before update` | Allowed. | Not allowed. A runtime error is thrown. | Not allowed. A runtime error is thrown. |
| `after update` | Not allowed. A runtime error is thrown, as `trigger.new` is already saved. | Allowed. Even though bad code could cause an infinite recursion doing this incorrectly, the error would be found by the governor limits. | Allowed. The updates are saved before the object is deleted, so if the object is undeleted, the updates become visible. |
| `before delete` | Not allowed. A runtime error is thrown. `trigger.new` is not available in before delete triggers. | Allowed. The updates are saved before the object is deleted, so if the object is undeleted, the updates become visible. | Not allowed. A runtime error is thrown. The deletion is already in progress. |
| `after delete` | Not allowed. A runtime error is thrown. `trigger.new` is not available in after delete triggers. | Not applicable. The object has already been deleted. | Not applicable. The object has already been deleted. |
| `after undelete` | Not allowed. A runtime error is thrown. | Allowed. | Allowed, but unnecessary. The object is deleted immediately after being inserted. |
