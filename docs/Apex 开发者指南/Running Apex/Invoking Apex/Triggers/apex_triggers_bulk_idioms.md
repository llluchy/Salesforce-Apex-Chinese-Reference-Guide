# Common Bulk Trigger Idioms

Although bulk triggers allow developers to process more records without exceeding execution governor limits, they can be more difficult for developers to understand and code because they involve processing batches of several records at a time. The following sections provide examples of idioms that should be used frequently when writing in bulk.

## Using Maps and Sets in Bulk Triggers

Set and map data structures are critical for successful coding of bulk triggers. Sets can be used to isolate distinct records, while maps can be used to hold query results organized by record ID.

For example, this bulk trigger from the sample quoting application first adds each pricebook entry associated with the OpportunityLineItem records in `Trigger.new` to a set, ensuring that the set contains only distinct elements. It then queries the PricebookEntries for their associated product color, and places the results in a map. Once the map is created, the trigger iterates through the OpportunityLineItems in `Trigger.new` and uses the map to assign the appropriate color.

```apex
// When a new line item is added to an opportunity, this trigger copies the value of the
// associated product's color to the new record.
trigger oppLineTrigger on OpportunityLineItem (before insert) {

    // For every OpportunityLineItem record, add its associated pricebook entry
    // to a set so there are no duplicates.
    Set pbeIds = new Set();
    for (OpportunityLineItem oli : Trigger.new) 
        pbeIds.add(oli.pricebookentryid);

    // Query the PricebookEntries for their associated product color and place the results
    // in a map.
    Map entries = new Map(
        [select product2.color__c from pricebookentry 
         where id in :pbeIds]);
         
    // Now use the map to set the appropriate color on every OpportunityLineItem processed
    // by the trigger.
    for (OpportunityLineItem oli : Trigger.new) 
        oli.color__c = entries.get(oli.pricebookEntryId).product2.color__c;  
}
```

## Correlating Records with Query Results in Bulk Triggers

Use the `Trigger.newMap` and `Trigger.oldMap` ID-to-sObject maps to correlate records with query results. For example, this trigger from the sample quoting app uses `Trigger.oldMap` to create a set of unique IDs (`Trigger.oldMap.keySet()`). The set is then used as part of a query to create a list of quotes associated with the opportunities being processed by the trigger. For every quote returned by the query, the related opportunity is retrieved from `Trigger.oldMap` and prevented from being deleted:

```apex
trigger oppTrigger on Opportunity (before delete) {
    for (Quote__c q : [SELECT opportunity__c FROM quote__c 
                       WHERE opportunity__c IN :Trigger.oldMap.keySet()]) {
        Trigger.oldMap.get(q.opportunity__c).addError('Cannot delete 
                                                       opportunity with a quote');
    }
}
```

## Using Triggers to Insert or Update Records with Unique Fields

When an `insert` or `upsert` event causes a record to duplicate the value of a unique field in another new record in that batch, the error message for the duplicate record includes the ID of the first record. However, it is possible that the error message may not be correct by the time the request is finished.

When there are triggers present, the retry logic in bulk operations causes a rollback/retry cycle to occur. That retry cycle assigns new keys to the new records. For example, if two records are inserted with the same value for a unique field, and you also have an `insert` event defined for a trigger, the second duplicate record fails, reporting the ID of the first record. However, once the system rolls back the changes and re-inserts the first record by itself, the record receives a new ID. That means the error message reported by the second record is no longer valid.
