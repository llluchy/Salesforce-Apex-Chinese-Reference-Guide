# Implementing DataWeave in Apex

Create DataWeave scripts as metadata and invoke them directly from Apex. Use class methods and exceptions in the DataWeave namespace to load and execute the scripts.

## DataWeave Namespace

The DataWeave namespace provides classes and methods to support the invocation of DataWeave scripts from Apex. The `Script` class contains the `createScript()` method to load DataWeave scripts from `.dwl` metadata files that have been deployed to an org. The resulting script can then be run with a payload using the `execute()` method to obtain script output in a `DataWeave.Result` object. The `Result` class contains methods to retrieve script output using `Script` class methods. For more information on these classes and methods, see [DataWeave Namespace](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_namespace_DataWeave.htm "HTML (New Window)").

For every DataWeave script, an inner class of type `DataWeaveScriptResource.ScriptName` is generated. The inner class extends the `DataWeave.Script` class. You can use the generated `DataWeaveScriptResource.ScriptName` class instead of using the actual script name via the `createScript()` method. DataWeave scripts that are currently being referenced via this inner class can't be deleted. To make the generated DataWeaveScriptResource class global, set the `isGlobal` field in the `DataWeaveResource` metadata object.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <DataWeaveResource xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata"> <apiVersion>58.0</apiVersion> <isGlobal>true</isGlobal> </DataWeaveResource>

The catchable `System.DataWeaveScriptException` exception is available for error handling. Runtime script exceptions that occur within DataWeave are exposed to Apex with this exception type.

DataWeave scripts support logging using the `log(string, value)` function. Log messages that originate from DataWeave are reflected in Apex debug logs as `DATAWEAVE_USER_DEBUG` events, under the Apex Code log category at the DEBUG log level.

## Supporting Information

These tools support the development of DataWeave scripts.

-   [DataWeave Interactive Learning](https://sfdc.co/dwlangfun "HTML (New Window)") is an online interactive playground that you can use to test your DataWeave scripts.
-   [DataWeave 2.0 VSCode marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MuleSoftInc.dataweave "HTML (New Window)") adds code highlighting and other feature support for editing DataWeave scripts.

## Versioned Behavior Changes

These versions of DataWeave script syntax are supported in Apex.

-   API version 61.0 and earlier: [DataWeave 2.5](https://docs.mulesoft.com/dataweave/2.5/)
-   API version 62.0: [DataWeave 2.8](https://docs.mulesoft.com/dataweave/2.8/)
-   API version 63.0 and later: [DataWeave 2.9](https://docs.mulesoft.com/dataweave/2.9/)
