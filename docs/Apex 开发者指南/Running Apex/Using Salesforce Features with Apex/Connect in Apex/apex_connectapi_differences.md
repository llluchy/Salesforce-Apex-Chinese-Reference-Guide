# Differences Between ConnectApi Classes and Other Apex Classes

Note these additional differences between `ConnectApi` classes and other Apex classes.

-   **User mode**: Connect in Apex methods run in the context of the current user (also called the *context user*). The methods have access to whatever the context user has access to. Connect in Apex doesn’t support the `runAs` system method. When a method takes a subjectId argument, often that subject must be the context user. In these cases, you can use the string `me` to specify the context user instead of an ID. Connect in Apex isn’t available to Automated Process users by default. Connect in Apex is available to these users:
    -   Chatter-only users
    -   Guest users
    -   Portal users
    -   Standard users
-   **`with sharing` and `without sharing`**: Connect in Apex ignores the `with sharing` and `without sharing` keywords. Instead, the context user controls all security, field level sharing, and visibility. For example, if the context user is a member of a private group, `ConnectApi` classes can post to that group. If the context user is not a member of a private group, the code can’t see the feed items for that group and can’t post to the group.
-   **Asynchronous operations**: Some Connect in Apex operations are asynchronous, that is, they don’t occur immediately. For example, if your code adds a feed item for a user, it isn’t immediately available in the news feed. Another example: when you add a photo, it’s not available immediately. For testing, if you add a photo, you can’t retrieve it immediately.
-   **No XML support in Apex REST**: Apex REST doesn’t support XML serialization and deserialization of Connect in Apex objects. Apex REST does support JSON serialization and deserialization of Connect in Apex objects.
-   **Empty log entries**: Information about Connect in Apex objects doesn’t appear in `VARIABLE_ASSIGNMENT` log events.
-   **No Apex SOAP web services support**: Connect in Apex objects can’t be used in Apex SOAP web services indicated with the keyword `webservice`.
