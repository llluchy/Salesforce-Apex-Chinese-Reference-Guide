# Understanding Limits for ConnectApi Classes

Limits for methods in the `ConnectApi` namespace are different than the limits for other Apex classes.

For classes in the `ConnectApi` namespace, every write operation costs one DML statement against the Apex governor limit. `ConnectApi` method calls are also subject to rate limits. Most `ConnectApi` method calls count toward the [Salesforce Platform total API request allocations](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet.meta/salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet/salesforce_app_limits_platform_api.htm), which are per org and span a 24-hour period. Only `ConnectApi` method calls that require Chatter are subject to a per user, per namespace, per hour rate limit. The documentation for every `ConnectApi` method indicates whether Chatter is required. When you exceed the rate limit, a `ConnectApi.RateLimitException` is thrown. Your Apex code must catch and handle this exception.

When testing code, a call to the Apex `Test.startTest` method starts a new rate limit count. A call to the `Test.stopTest` method sets your rate limit count to the value it was before you called `Test.startTest`.
