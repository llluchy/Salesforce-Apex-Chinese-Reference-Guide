# Set Up a Synchronous Payment Gateway Adapter

For payments transactions, you can configure Salesforce to interface with a synchronous payment gateway adapter.

<table class="editionTable" border="0" summary="Salesforce editions needed for the documented functionality" width="100%"><tbody class="tbody"><tr><td class="subHead">Available in: Salesforce Summer ’20 and later</td></tr><tr><td class="subHead">Available in: API 49.0 and later</td></tr></tbody></table>

  

To access the `commercepayments` API, you need the PaymentPlatform org permission.

1.  Create your payment gateway adapter Apex classes. For instructions, see [Building a Synchronous Gateway Adapter](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_commercepayments_sync_adapter_concept.htm "In synchronous payment configurations, the Salesforce payment platform sends transaction information to the gateway, and then waits for a gateway response that contains the final transaction status. Salesforce creates a transaction only if the transaction is successful in the gateway.").
2.  Create a named credential.
    1.  From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Named Credentials, and then select **New.**.
    2.  Complete the required fields, including the URL for your payment gateway.
3.  Create a payment gateway provider. The PaymentGatewayProvider object stores details about the payment gateway that Salesforce Payments communicates with when processing a transaction.
    1.  Generate an access token according to the instructions in [Connect to Connect REST API Using OAuth](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/quickstart_connecting.htm "HTML (New Window)").
        
        The response includes the access token, specified in the `access_token` property, and the server instance, specified in the `instance_url` property. Use this information to make API calls to build the payment gateway provider.
        
    2.  Execute a POST call to the resource using the domain in the `instance_url`. For example, `https://instance_name.my.salesforce.com/services/data/vapi_version/tooling/sobjects/PaymentGatewayProvider`.
        
        Use this payload as the request body, replacing value with the correct data.

```plain
{
        "ApexAdapterId": "value",
        "DeveloperName": "value",
        "MasterLabel": "value",
        "IdempotencySupported": "value",
        "Comments": "value"
        }
        
        Example:
        {
        "ApexAdapterId": "01pxx0000004UU8AAM",
        "DeveloperName": "MyNewGatewayProvider",
        "MasterLabel": "My New Gateway Provider",
        "IdempotencySupported": "Yes",
        "Comments": "Custom made gateway provider."
        }
```

        
4.  Create a payment gateway record. The PaymentGateway object stores information about the connection to the external payment gateway. The record requires these field values.
    -   Payment Gateway Name: Name of the external payment gateway.
    -   Merchant Credential ID: ID of the named credential that you created.
    -   Payment Gateway Provider ID: ID of the payment gateway provider that you created.
    -   Status: Active
