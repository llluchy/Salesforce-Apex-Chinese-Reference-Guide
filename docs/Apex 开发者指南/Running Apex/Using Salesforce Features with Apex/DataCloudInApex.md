# Data 360 In Apex

You can use Apex with Data 360 objects, with constraints and considerations that are detailed in this topic . Further, you can mock SOQL query responses for Data 360 data model objects (DMOs) in Apex testing by using SOQL stub methods and a test class.

## Using SOQL in Apex with Data 360 Objects

Static SOQL is supported with Data 360 data model objects (DMOs) as a more direct alternative to using either dynamic SOQL or ConnectAPI. Additionally, SOQL queries against DMOs using Apex `Database.QueryLocator` or in FOR loops is supported in API version 61.0 and later. In versions earlier than 61.0, only the first 201 records are returned. Batch Apex is blocked against DMOs when using `QueryLocators`, but is supported when using `Iterable`.

:::tip Warning
Running SOQL queries against DMOs can result in Data Services credits being
                consumed from your Data 360 subscription. For more information on how usage is
                billed, see [Data 360 Billable Usage Types](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=data.c360_a_data_usage_types.htm&language=en_US). Use caution
                when using FOR loops, query locators, recursion, or any mechanism that can result in
                multiple queries to Data 360.
:::

A static SOQL query against Data 360 from Apex is considered a callout and is subject to the same restrictions as HTTP callouts from Apex. For example, if there is pending DML, this sample code can result in an unexpected exception with this message: `UnexpectedException: A callout was unsuccessful because of pending uncommitted work related to a process, flow, or Apex operation. Commit or roll back the work, and then try again.`

insert new Account(Name='Test'); List<ssot\_Account\_dlm> dmo1 = \[Select Id from ssot\_Account\_dlm\];

## Security Considerations

You must consider field- and record-level access when using Apex with Data 360 data model objects (DMOs). DMOs in all data spaces are accessible from Apex in system mode, even when a permission set for the data space isn’t explicitly assigned. Read-only object-level access checks are supported if the user has access to the data space. There’s currently no support for field-level security or for record-level access control. Apex features, such as WITH USER\_MODE, WITH SECURITY\_ENFORCED, describe calls, and  `Security.stripInaccessible()`, can check only object-level access for DMOs.

Starting with API version 61.0, you can get information on a specific DMO using `SObjectType.getDescribe()`. There’s no field-level security to be enforced because all fields on DMOs that are accessed by field describes and security model checks are read only. You can’t use `Schema.getGlobalDescribe()` to discover exposed DMOs. Instead, use the `Schema.describeSObjects(List<String>)` method with the known DMO API names.

This example uses static SOQL with the UnifiedIndividual\_\_dlm Data 360 object.

//Static SOQL example List<UnifiedIndividual\_\_dlm> unifiedIndividuals = \[ SELECT Id, ssot\_\_FirstName\_\_c, ssot\_\_LastName\_\_c, ssot\_\_Email\_\_c, ssot\_\_SkyMilesBalance\_\_c, ssot\_\_MedallionStatus\_\_c FROM UnifiedIndividual\_\_dlm WHERE ssot\_\_CompanyId\_\_c = :companyId \];
