# Using Patterns and Matchers

Apex provides patterns and matchers that enable you to search text using regular expressions.

A pattern is a compiled representation of a regular expression. Patterns are used by matchers to perform match operations on a character string.

A **regular expression** is a string that is used to match another string, using a specific syntax. Apex supports the use of regular expressions through its **Pattern** and **Matcher** classes.

:::tip Note
In Apex, Patterns and Matchers, as well as regular expressions, are based
on their counterparts in Java. See [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?java/util/regex/Pattern.html](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?java/util/regex/Pattern.html).
:::

Many Matcher objects can share the same Pattern object, as shown in the following illustration:

Many Matcher objects can be created from the same Pattern object ![A flow chart showing flow from Regular Expression to Matcher object](/docs/resources/img/en-us/262.0?doc_id=dev_guides%2Fapex%2Fimages%2FPatternAndMatcher.gif&folder=apexcode)

Regular expressions in Apex follow the standard syntax for regular expressions used in Java. Any Java-based regular expression strings can be easily imported into your Apex code.

:::tip Note
Salesforce limits the number of times an input sequence for a regular
expression can be accessed to 1,000,000 times. If you reach that limit,
you receive a runtime error.
:::

All regular expressions are specified as strings. Most regular expressions are first compiled into a Pattern object: only the String `split` method takes a regular expression that isn't compiled.

Generally, after you compile a regular expression into a Pattern object, you only use the Pattern object once to create a Matcher object. All further actions are then performed using the Matcher object. For example:

```apex
// First, instantiate a new Pattern object "MyPattern"
Pattern MyPattern = Pattern.compile('a*b');

// Then instantiate a new Matcher object "MyMatcher"
Matcher MyMatcher = MyPattern.matcher('aaaaab');

// You can use the system static method assert to verify the match
System.assert(MyMatcher.matches());
```

If you are only going to use a regular expression once, use the `Pattern` class `matches` method to compile the expression and match a string against it in a single invocation. For example, the following is equivalent to the code above:

```apex
Boolean Test = Pattern.matches('a*b', 'aaaaab');
```
