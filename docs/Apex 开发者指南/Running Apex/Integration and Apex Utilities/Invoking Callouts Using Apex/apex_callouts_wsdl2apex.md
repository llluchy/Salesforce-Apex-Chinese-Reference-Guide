# SOAP Services: Defining a Class from a WSDL Document

Classes can be automatically generated from a WSDL document that is stored on a local hard drive or network. Creating a class by consuming a WSDL document allows developers to make callouts to the external Web service in their Apex code.

:::tip Note
Use Outbound Messaging to handle integration solutions when possible. Use callouts to
      third-party Web services only when necessary.
:::

To generate an Apex class from a WSDL:

1.  In the application, from Setup, enter Apex Classes in the Quick Find box, then select **Apex Classes**.
2.  Click **Generate from WSDL**.
3.  Click **Browse** to navigate to a WSDL document on your local hard drive or network, or type in the full path. This WSDL document is the basis for the Apex class you are creating. 

:::tip Note
The WSDL document that you specify might contain a SOAP endpoint location that
            references an outbound port.

          For security reasons, Salesforce restricts the outbound ports
            you can specify to one of the following:

          
            - 80: This port only accepts HTTP connections.

            - 443: This port only accepts HTTPS connections.

            - 1024–66535 (inclusive): These ports accept HTTP or HTTPS connections.
:::

4.  Click **Parse WSDL** to verify the WSDL document contents. The application generates a default class name for each namespace in the WSDL document and reports any errors. Parsing fails if the WSDL contains schema types or constructs that aren’t supported by Apex classes, or if the resulting classes exceed the 1 million character limit on Apex classes. For example, the Salesforce SOAP API WSDL cannot be parsed.
5.  Modify the class names as desired. While you can save more than one WSDL namespace into a single class by using the same class name for each namespace, Apex classes can be no more than 1 million characters total.
6.  Click **Generate Apex**. The final page of the wizard shows which classes were successfully generated, along with any errors from other classes. The page also provides a link to view successfully generated code.

The successfully generated Apex classes include stub and type classes for calling the third-party Web service represented by the WSDL document. These classes allow you to call the external Web service from Apex. For each generated class, a second class is created with the same name and with a prefix of `Async`. The first class is for synchronous callouts. The second class is for asynchronous callouts. For more information about asynchronous callouts, see [Make Long-Running Callouts with Continuations](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_continuation_overview.htm "Use asynchronous callouts to make long-running requests from a Visualforce page or a Lightning component to an external Web service and process responses in callback methods.").

Note the following about the generated Apex:

-   If a WSDL document contains an Apex reserved word, the word is appended with `_x` when the Apex class is generated. For example, `limit` in a WSDL document converts to `limit_x` in the generated Apex class. See [Reserved Keywords](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_reserved_words.htm "These words can be used only as keywords."). For details on handling characters in element names in a WSDL that are not supported in Apex variable names, see [Considerations Using WSDLs](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_callouts_wsdl2apex_considerations.htm).
-   If an operation in the WSDL has an output message with more than one element, the generated Apex wraps the elements in an inner class. The Apex method that represents the WSDL operation returns the inner class instead of the individual elements.
-   Since periods (`.`) are not allowed in Apex class names, any periods in WSDL names used to generate Apex classes are replaced by underscores (`_`) in the generated Apex code.

After you have generated a class from the WSDL, you can invoke the external service referenced by the WSDL.

:::tip Note
Before you can use the samples in the rest of this topic, you must copy the Apex class
        `docSampleClass` from [Generated WSDL2Apex Code](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_callouts_wsdl2apex_gen_code.htm) and add it to your
      organization.
:::

## Invoking an External Service

To invoke an external service after using its WSDL document to generate an Apex class, create an instance of the stub in your Apex code and call the methods on it. For example, to invoke the [StrikeIron IP address lookup service](http://ws.strikeiron.com/relauto/iplookup?WSDL "HTML (New Window)") from Apex, you could write code similar to the following:

```apex
// Create the stub
  strikeironIplookup.DNSSoap dns = new strikeironIplookup.DNSSoap();

  // Set up the license header
  dns.LicenseInfo = new strikeiron.LicenseInfo();
  dns.LicenseInfo.RegisteredUser = new strikeiron.RegisteredUser();
  dns.LicenseInfo.RegisteredUser.UserID = 'you@company.com';
  dns.LicenseInfo.RegisteredUser.Password = 'your-password';

  // Make the Web service call
  strikeironIplookup.DNSInfo info = dns.DNSLookup('www.myname.com');
```

## HTTP Header Support

You can set the HTTP headers on a Web service callout. For example, you can use this feature to set the value of a cookie in an authorization header. To set HTTP headers, add `inputHttpHeaders_x` and `outputHttpHeaders_x` to the stub.

:::tip Note
In API versions 16.0 and earlier, HTTP responses for
        callouts are always decoded using UTF-8, regardless of the Content-Type header. In API
        versions 17.0 and later, HTTP responses are decoded using the encoding specified in the
        Content-Type header.
:::

The following samples work with the sample WSDL file in [Generated WSDL2Apex Code](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_callouts_wsdl2apex_gen_code.htm "You can generate Apex classes from a WSDL document using the WSDL2Apex tool. The WSDL2Apex tool is open source and available on GitHub."):

## Sending HTTP Headers on a Web Service Callout

```apex
docSample.DocSamplePort stub = new docSample.DocSamplePort();
stub.inputHttpHeaders_x = new MapString, String>();

//Setting a basic authentication header
// Tip: Use named credentials instead.
stub.inputHttpHeaders_x.put('Authorization', 'Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==');

//Setting a cookie header
stub.inputHttpHeaders_x.put('Cookie', 'name=value');

//Setting a custom HTTP header
stub.inputHttpHeaders_x.put('myHeader', 'myValue');

String input = 'This is the input string';
String output = stub.EchoString(input);
```

If a value for `inputHttpHeaders_x` is specified, it overrides the standard headers set.

:::tip Tip
Instead of hardcoding the `Authorization`
        header value, use named credentials. Named credentials offer a declarative and secure way to
        store and manage the credentials needed for HTTP callouts so that Salesforce can
        authenticate with external APIs. For more information, see [Named Credentials](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.named_credentials_about.htm&language=en_US) in
          Salesforce Help.
:::

## Accessing HTTP Response Headers from a Web Service Callout Response

```apex
docSample.DocSamplePort stub = new docSample.DocSamplePort();
stub.outputHttpHeaders_x = new MapString, String>();
String input = 'This is the input string';
String output = stub.EchoString(input);

//Getting cookie header
String cookie = stub.outputHttpHeaders_x.get('Set-Cookie');

//Getting custom header
String myHeader = stub.outputHttpHeaders_x.get('My-Header');
```

The value of `outputHttpHeaders_x` is null by default. You must set `outputHttpHeaders_x` before you have access to the content of headers in the response.

## Supported WSDL Features

Apex supports only the document literal wrapped WSDL style and the following primitive and built-in datatypes:

| Schema Type | Apex Type |
| --- | --- |
| `xsd:anyURI` | String |
| `xsd:boolean` | Boolean |
| `xsd:date` | Date |
| `xsd:dateTime` | Datetime |
| `xsd:double` | Double |
| `xsd:float` | Double |
| `xsd:int` | Integer |
| `xsd:integer` | Integer |
| `xsd:language` | String |
| `xsd:long` | Long |
| `xsd:Name` | String |
| `xsd:NCName` | String |
| `xsd:nonNegativeInteger` | Integer |
| `xsd:NMTOKEN` | String |
| `xsd:NMTOKENS` | String |
| `xsd:normalizedString` | String |
| `xsd:NOTATION` | String |
| `xsd:positiveInteger` | Integer |
| `xsd:QName` | String |
| `xsd:short` | Integer |
| `xsd:string` | String |
| `xsd:time` | Datetime |
| `xsd:token` | String |
| `xsd:unsignedInt` | Integer |
| `xsd:unsignedLong` | Long |
| `xsd:unsignedShort` | Integer |

:::tip Note
The Salesforce datatype anyType is not supported in WSDLs used to
        generate Apex code that is saved using API version 15.0 and later. For code saved using API
        version 14.0 and earlier, anyType is mapped to String.
:::

Apex also supports the following schema constructs:

-   `xsd:all`, in Apex code saved using API version 15.0 and later
-   `xsd:annotation`, in Apex code saved using API version 15.0 and later
-   `xsd:attribute`, in Apex code saved using API version 15.0 and later
-   `xsd:choice`, in Apex code saved using API version 15.0 and later
-   `xsd:element`. In Apex code saved using API version 15.0 and later, the `ref` attribute is also supported with the following restrictions:
    -   You cannot call a `ref` in a different namespace.
    -   A global element cannot use `ref`.
    -   If an element contains `ref`, it cannot also contain `name` or `type`.
-   `xsd:sequence`

The following data types are only supported when used as **call ins**, that is, when an external Web service calls an Apex Web service method. These data types are not supported as **callouts**, that is, when an Apex Web service method calls an external Web service.

-   blob
-   decimal
-   enum

Apex does not support any other WSDL constructs, types, or services, including:

-   RPC/encoded services
-   WSDL files with multiple `portTypes`, multiple services, or multiple bindings
-   WSDL files that import external schemas. For example, the following WSDL fragment imports an external schema, which is not supported:

```xml
>
    
     elementFormDefault="qualified"
     targetNamespace="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
       schemaLocation="AmazonS3.xsd"/>
    >
  >
```

    
    However, an import within the same schema is supported. In the following example, the external WSDL is pasted into the WSDL you are converting:
    
    

```xml
>
    
      xmlns:tns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/"
      xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
      elementFormDefault="qualified"
      targetNamespace="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">

       name="CreateBucket">
        >
          >
     [...]
    >
  >
```

-   Any schema types not documented in the previous table
-   WSDLs that exceed the size limit, including the Salesforce WSDLs
-   WSDLs that don’t use the document literal wrapped style. The following WSDL snippet doesn’t use document literal wrapped style and results in an “Unable to find complexType” error when imported.

```xml
>
     targetNamespace="http://test.org/AccountPollInterface/" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
       name="SFDCPollAccountsResponse" type="tns:SFDCPollResponse"/>
       name="SFDCPollResponse">
           base="xsd:string" />
      >
    >
  >
```

 This modified version wraps the `simpleType` element as a `complexType` that contains a sequence of elements. This follows the document literal style and is supported.

```xml
>
     targetNamespace="http://test.org/AccountPollInterface/" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
       name="SFDCPollAccountsResponse" type="tns:SFDCPollResponse" />
       name="SFDCPollResponse">
        >
           name="SFDCOutput" type="xsd:string" />
        >
      >
    >
  >
```
