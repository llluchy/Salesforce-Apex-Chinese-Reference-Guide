# Testing Example

The following example includes cases for the following types of tests:

-   [Positive case with single and multiple records](#positive_test_case)
-   [Negative case with single and multiple records](#negative_test_case)
-   [Testing with other users](#second_user)

The test is used with a simple mileage tracking application. The existing code for the application verifies that not more than 500 miles are entered in a single day. The primary object is a custom object named Mileage\_\_c. The test creates one record with 300 miles and verifies there are only 300 miles recorded. Then a loop creates 200 records with one mile each. Finally, it verifies there are 500 miles recorded in total (the original 300 plus the new ones). Here’s the entire test class. The following sections step through specific portions of the code.

```apex
@isTest
private class MileageTrackerTestSuite {

    static testMethod void runPositiveTestCases() {
        
        Double totalMiles = 0;
        final Double maxtotalMiles = 500;
        final Double singletotalMiles = 300;
        final Double u2Miles = 100;
  
        
        //Set up user
        User u1 = [SELECT Id FROM User WHERE Alias='auser'];
        
        //Run As U1
        System.RunAs(u1){

            
        System.debug('Inserting 300  miles... (single record validation)');
        
        Mileage__c testMiles1 = new Mileage__c(Miles__c = 300, Date__c = System.today());
        insert testMiles1;
        
        //Validate single insert
        for(Mileage__c m:[SELECT miles__c FROM Mileage__c 
            WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY
            and CreatedById = :u1.id
            and miles__c != null]) {
                totalMiles += m.miles__c;
            }
        
        Assert.areEqual(singletotalMiles, totalMiles);
    
    
        //Bulk validation   
        totalMiles = 0; 
        System.debug('Inserting 200 mileage records... (bulk validation)');
        
        List testMiles2 = new List();
        for(integer i=0; inew Mileage__c(Miles__c = 1, Date__c = System.today()) );
        }
        insert testMiles2;
       
        for(Mileage__c m:[SELECT miles__c FROM Mileage__c
            WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY
            and CreatedById = :u1.Id
            and miles__c != null]) {
                totalMiles += m.miles__c;
            }
        
        Assert.areEqual(maxtotalMiles, totalMiles);

        }//end RunAs(u1)

       //Validate additional user:
       totalMiles = 0;
       //Setup RunAs
       User u2 = [SELECT Id FROM User WHERE Alias='tuser'];
       System.RunAs(u2){
        
        Mileage__c testMiles3 = new Mileage__c(Miles__c = 100, Date__c = System.today());
        insert testMiles3;
        
                for(Mileage__c m:[SELECT miles__c FROM Mileage__c
            WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY
            and CreatedById = :u2.Id
            and miles__c != null]) {
                totalMiles += m.miles__c;
            }
        //Validate 
        Assert.areEqual(u2Miles, totalMiles);
        
       } //System.RunAs(u2)

      
    } // runPositiveTestCases()
   
    static testMethod void runNegativeTestCases() {

        User u3 = [SELECT Id FROM User WHERE Alias='tuser'];
        System.RunAs(u3) {

           System.debug('Inserting a record with 501 miles... (negative test case)'); 

           Mileage__c testMiles3 = new Mileage__c( Miles__c = 501, Date__c = System.today() );

           try {
               insert testMiles3;
               Assert.fail('DmlException expected');
           } catch (DmlException e) {
               //Assert Status Code
               Assert.areEqual('FIELD_CUSTOM_VALIDATION_EXCEPTION', e.getDmlStatusCode(0));
            
               //Assert field
               Assert.areEqual(Mileage__c.Miles__c, e.getDmlFields(0)[0]);
                        
               //Assert Error Message
               Assert.isTrue(e.getMessage().contains(
                'Mileage request exceeds daily limit(500): [Miles__c]'),
                'DMLException did not contain expected validation message:' + e.getMessage() );
            
             } //catch
           } //RunAs(u3) 
    } // runNegativeTestCases() 
  
    
} // class MileageTrackerTestSuite
```

## Positive Test Case

The following steps through the above code, in particular, the positive test case for single and multiple records.

1.  Add text to the debug log, indicating the next step of the code:

```apex
System.debug('Inserting 300 more miles...single record validation');
```

2.  Create a Mileage\_\_c object and insert it into the database.

```apex
Mileage__c testMiles1 = new Mileage__c(Miles__c = 300, Date__c = System.today() );
insert testMiles1;
```

3.  Validate the code by returning the inserted records:

```apex
for(Mileage__c m:[SELECT miles__c FROM Mileage__c 
   WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY 
   and CreatedById = :createdbyId 
   and miles__c != null]) {
       totalMiles += m.miles__c;
    }
```

4.  Use the `Assert.areEqual` method to verify that the expected result is returned:

```apex
Assert.areEqual(singletotalMiles, totalMiles);
```

5.  Before moving to the next test, set the number of total miles back to 0:

```apex
totalMiles = 0;
```

6.  Validate the code by creating a bulk insert of 200 records.
    
    First, add text to the debug log, indicating the next step of the code:

```apex
System.debug('Inserting 200 Mileage records...bulk validation');
```

    
7.  Then insert 200 Mileage\_\_c records:

```apex
List testMiles2 = new List();
for(Integer i=0; inew Mileage__c(Miles__c = 1, Date__c = System.today()) );
   }
insert testMiles2;
```

8.  Use `Assert.areEqual` to verify that the expected result is returned:

```apex
for(Mileage__c m:[SELECT miles__c FROM Mileage__c 
   WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY 
   and CreatedById = :CreatedbyId 
   and miles__c != null]) {
       totalMiles += m.miles__c;
    }
       Assert.areEqual(maxtotalMiles, totalMiles);
```

## Negative Test Case

The following steps through the above code, in particular, the negative test case.

1.  Create a static test method called `runNegativeTestCases`:

```apex
static testMethod void runNegativeTestCases(){
```

2.  Add text to the debug log, indicating the next step of the code:

```apex
System.debug('Inserting 501 miles... negative test case');
```

3.  Create a Mileage\_\_c record with 501 miles. 

```apex
Mileage__c testMiles3 = new Mileage__c(Miles__c = 501, Date__c = System.today());
```

4.  Place the `insert` statement within a `try`/`catch` block. This allows you to catch the validation exception and assert the generated error message. Use the `Assert.fail` method to clearly assert that you expect the validation exception.

```apex
try {
     insert testMiles3;
     Assert.fail('DmlException expected');
     } catch (DmlException e) {
```

5.  Now use the `Assert.areEqual` and `Assert.isTrue` methods to do the testing. Add the following code to the `catch` block you previously created:

```apex
//Assert Status Code
Assert.areEqual('FIELD_CUSTOM_VALIDATION_EXCEPTION', e.getDmlStatusCode(0));
            
//Assert field
Assert.areEqual(Mileage__c.Miles__c, e.getDmlFields(0)[0]);
                        
//Assert Error Message
Assert.isTrue(e.getMessage().contains(
  'Mileage request exceeds daily limit(500): [Miles__c]'),
  'DMLException did not contain expected validation message:' + e.getMessage() );
```

## Testing as a Second User

The following steps through the above code, in particular, running as a second user.

1.  Before moving to the next test, set the number of total miles back to 0:

```apex
totalMiles = 0;
```

2.  Set up the next user.

```apex
User u2 = [SELECT Id FROM User WHERE Alias='tuser'];
       System.RunAs(u2){
```

3.  Add text to the debug log, indicating the next step of the code:

```apex
System.debug('Setting up testing - deleting any mileage records for ' +
            UserInfo.getUserName() +
            ' from today');
```

4.  Then insert one Mileage\_\_c record:

```apex
Mileage__c testMiles3 = new Mileage__c(Miles__c = 100, Date__c = System.today());
insert testMiles3;
```

5.  Validate the code by returning the inserted records:

```apex
for(Mileage__c m:[SELECT miles__c FROM Mileage__c 
   WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY 
   and CreatedById = :u2.Id 
   and miles__c != null]) {
       totalMiles += m.miles__c;
    }
```

6.  Use the `Assert.areEqual` method to verify that the expected result is returned:

```apex
Assert.areEqual(u2Miles, totalMiles);
```
