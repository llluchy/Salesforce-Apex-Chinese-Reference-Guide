# Using Limits, startTest , and stopTest

The Limits methods return the specific limit for the particular governor, such as the number of calls of a method or the amount of heap size remaining.

Each method has two versions. The first version returns the amount of the resource that has been used in the current context. The second version contains the word “limit” and returns the total amount of the resource that is available for that context. For example, `getCallouts` returns the number of callouts to an external service that have already been processed in the current context, while `getLimitCallouts` returns the total number of callouts available in the given context.

In addition to the Limits methods, use the `startTest` and `stopTest` methods to validate how close the code is to reaching governor limits.

The `startTest` method marks the point in your test code when your test actually begins. Each test method is allowed to call this method only once. All of the code before this method should be used to initialize variables, populate data structures, and so on, allowing you to set up everything you need to run your test. Any code that executes after the call to `startTest` and before `stopTest` is assigned a new set of governor limits.

The `startTest` method does not refresh the context of the test: it adds a context to your test. For example, if your class makes 98 SOQL queries before it calls `startTest`, and the first significant statement after `startTest` is a DML statement, the program can now make an additional 100 queries. Once `stopTest` is called, however, the program goes back into the original context, and can only make 2 additional SOQL queries before reaching the limit of 100.

The `stopTest` method marks the point in your test code when your test ends. Use this method in conjunction with the `startTest` method. Each test method is allowed to call this method only once. Any code that executes after the `stopTest` method is assigned the original limits that were in effect before `startTest` was called. All asynchronous calls made after the `startTest` method are collected by the system. When `stopTest` is executed, all asynchronous processes are run synchronously. An exception encountered during `stopTest` halts the synchronous processing. For example, an unhandled exception in a batch job’s `execute` method will prevent the `finish` method from running in a test context.
