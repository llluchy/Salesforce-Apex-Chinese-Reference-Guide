# Exception Statements

Apex uses **exceptions** to note errors and other events that disrupt the normal flow of code execution. `throw` statements can be used to generate exceptions, while `try`, `catch`, and `finally` can be used to gracefully recover from an exception.

## Throw Statements

A `throw` statement allows you to signal that an error has occurred. To throw an exception, use the `throw` statement and provide it with an exception object to provide information about the specific error. For example:

```apex
throw exceptionObject;
```

## Try-Catch-Finally Statements

The `try`, `catch`, and `finally` statements can be used to gracefully recover from a thrown exception:

-   The `try` statement identifies a block of code in which an exception can occur.
-   The `catch` statement identifies a block of code that can handle a particular type of exception. A single `try` statement can have zero or more associated `catch` statements. Each `catch` statement must have a unique exception type. Also, once a particular exception type is caught in one `catch` block, the remaining `catch` blocks, if any, aren’t executed.
-   The `finally` statement identifies a block of code that is guaranteed to execute and allows you to clean up your code. A single `try` statement can have up to one associated `finally` statement. Code in the `finally` block always executes regardless of whether an exception was thrown or the type of exception that was thrown. Because the `finally` block always executes, use it for cleanup code, such as for freeing up resources.

## Syntax

The syntax of the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` statements is as follows.

```apex
try {
  // Try block
 code_block
} catch (exceptionType variableName) {
  // Initial catch block.
  // At least the catch block or the finally block must be present. 
 code_block
} catch (Exception e) {
  // Optional additional catch statement for other exception types.
  // Note that the general exception type, 'Exception',
  // must be the last catch block when it is used.
 code_block
} finally {
  // Finally block.
  // At least the catch block or the finally block must be present.
 code_block
}
```

At least a `catch` block or a `finally` block must be present with a `try` block. The following is the syntax of a try-catch block.

```apex
try {
 code_block
} catch (exceptionType variableName) {
 code_block
}
// Optional additional catch blocks
```

The following is the syntax of a try-finally block.

```apex
try {
 code_block
} finally {
 code_block
}
```

This is a skeletal example of a try-catch-finally block.

```apex
try {
    // Perform some operation that 
    //   might cause an exception.
} catch(Exception e) {
    // Generic exception handling code here.
} finally {
    // Perform some clean up.
}
```

## Exceptions that Can’t be Caught

Some special types of built-in exceptions can’t be caught. Those exceptions are associated with critical situations in the Lightning Platform. These situations require the abortion of code execution and don’t allow for execution to resume through exception handling. One such exception is the limit exception (`System.LimitException`) that the runtime throws if a governor limit such as heap size or CPU time has been exceeded, when the maximum number of SOQL queries issued has been exceeded, an attempt is made to retrieve more than the maximum number of records, and so on. Other examples are exceptions thrown when assertion statements fail (through `System.assert` methods) or license exceptions.

When exceptions are uncatchable, `catch` blocks, as well as `finally` blocks if any, aren’t executed.

## Versioned Behavior Changes

In API version 41.0 and later, unreachable statements in your code will cause compilation errors. For example, the following code block generates a compile time error in API version 41.0 and later. The third statement can never be reached because the previous statement throws an unconditional exception.

```apex
Boolean x = true; 
throw new NullPointerException();
x = false;
```
