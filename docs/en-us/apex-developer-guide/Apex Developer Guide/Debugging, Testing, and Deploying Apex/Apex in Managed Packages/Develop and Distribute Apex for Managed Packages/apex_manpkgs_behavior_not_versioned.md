# Apex Code Items That Aren’t Versioned

Some Apex items in managed packages can’t be versioned. The changes that you make to these items are reflected across all package versions. Additionally, there are limitations to the changes that you can make to some of these items when they are used in Apex code in managed packages.

As a package developer, you can add or remove these items from Apex in manage packages.

-   `@Future`
-   `@IsTest`
-   `with sharing`
-   `without sharing`
-   `transient`

You can make limited changes to these Apex items in managed packages.

-   `private`—can be changed to `global`
-   `protected`—can be changed to `global`
-   `public`—can be changed to `global`
-   `abstract`—can be changed to `virtual` but can’t be removed
-   `final`—can be removed but can’t be added

You can’t remove or change these Apex items in managed packages.

-   `global`
-   `virtual`

You can add the `webservice` keyword, but once it has been added, it can’t be removed.

:::tip Note
You can’t deprecate `webservice`
      methods or variables in managed package code.
:::

If a package upgrade includes an explicit global constructor for a released global class that previously only had an implicit constructor, then the new, explicit constructor will be called from the subscriber. Also, you can’t reduce the access modifier on the default constructor on a released global class in a package. See [Best Practices for Using Global Apex in Managed Packages](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_manpkgs_global_best_practices.htm "As an independent software vendor (ISV) developer, understand when and how to use global Apex in managed packages. Learn design patterns that maximize flexibility and comply with the strict manageability rules applied to global Apex after your managed package’s release. By following these best practices, you can improve the stability and maintainability of your API.").
