# Version Apex Code Behavior

Package developers can use conditional logic in Apex classes and triggers to exhibit different behavior for different versions. With this conditional logic, you can support existing behavior in classes and triggers in previous package versions while evolving the code.

:::tip Note
Starting in Summer ’25, package subscribers can use Version Settings to specify the
            version of a migrated second-generation managed package (2GP) that an Apex class depends
            on. This functionality is already available to first-generation managed packages (1GP),
            but isn’t yet supported in 2GP packages that weren’t converted from a 1GP package. See
                [Apex Version Settings in Migrated Second-Generation
                Managed Packages (2GP)](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005101483&type=1&language=en_US).

When subscribers install multiple versions of your package and write code that references Apex classes or triggers in your package, they must [select the version](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_version_settings_intro.htm "To aid backwards-compatibility, classes and triggers are stored with the version settings for a specific Salesforce API version.") that they’re referencing. Within the Apex code that is being referenced in your package, you can conditionally execute different code paths based on the version setting of the calling Apex code that is making the reference. The package version setting of the calling code can be determined within the package code by calling the `System.requestVersion` method. In this way, package developers can determine the request context and specify different behavior for different versions of the package.

This example uses the `System.requestVersion` method and instantiates the `System.Version` class to define different behaviors in an Apex trigger for different package versions.

```apex
trigger oppValidation on Opportunity (before insert, before update) {

    for (Opportunity opp : Trigger.new){
    
        // Add a new validation to the package
        // Applies to versions of the managed package greater than 1.0
        if (System.requestVersion().compareTo(new Version(1,0)) > 0) {
            if (opp.Probability >= 50 && opp.Description == null) {
                opp.addError('All deals over 50% require a description');
            }
        }

        // Validation applies to all versions of the managed package.
        if (opp.IsWon == true && opp.LeadSource == null) {
            opp.addError('A lead source must be provided for all Closed Won deals');
        }
    }
}
```

For a full list of methods that work with package versions, see [Version Class](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_version.htm) and the `System.requestVersion` method in [System Class](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_system.htm).

The request context persists if a class in an installed package invokes a method of another class in the package. For example, imagine that a subscriber installs a GeoReports package that contains CountryUtil and ContinentUtil classes. The subscriber creates a GeoReportsEx class and associates it with version 2.3 of the GeoReports package. If GeoReportsEx invokes a ContinentUtil method that internally invokes a CountryUtil method, the request context propagates from ContinentUtil to CountryUtil. Therefore, the `System.requestVersion` method in CountryUtil returns version 2.3 of the GeoReports package.
