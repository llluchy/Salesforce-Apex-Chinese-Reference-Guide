# Paging with the Apex Connector Framework

When displaying a large set of records in the user interface, Salesforce breaks the set into batches and displays one batch. You can then page through those batches. However, custom adapters for Salesforce Connect don’t automatically support paging of any kind. To support paging through external object data that’s obtained by a custom adapter, implement server-driven or client-driven paging.

With server-driven paging, the external system controls the paging and ignores any batch boundaries or page sizes that are specified in queries. To enable server-driven paging, declare the `QUERY_PAGINATION_SERVER_DRIVEN` capability in your `DataSource.Provider` class. Also, your Apex code must generate a query token and use it to determine and fetch the next batch of results.

With client-driven paging, you use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses to page through result sets. Factor in the `offset` and `maxResults` properties in the `DataSource.QueryContext` to determine which rows to return. For example, suppose that the result set has 20 rows with numeric `ExternalID` values from 1 to 20. If we ask for an `offset` of `5` and `maxResults` of `5`, we expect to get the rows with IDs `6`–`10`. We recommend that you do all filtering in the external system, outside of Apex, using methods that the external system supports.
