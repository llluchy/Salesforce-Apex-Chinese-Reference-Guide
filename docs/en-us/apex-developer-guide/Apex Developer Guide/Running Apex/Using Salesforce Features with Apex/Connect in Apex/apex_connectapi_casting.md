# Casting ConnectApi Objects

It may be useful to downcast some `ConnectApi` output objects to a more specific type.

This technique is especially useful for message segments, feed item capabilities, and record fields. Message segments in a feed item are typed as `ConnectApi.MessageSegment`. Feed item capabilities are typed as `ConnectApi.FeedItemCapability`. Record fields are typed as `ConnectApi.AbstractRecordField`. These classes are all abstract and have several concrete subclasses. At runtime you can use `instanceof` to check the concrete types of these objects and then safely proceed with the corresponding downcast. When you downcast, you must have a default case that handles unknown subclasses.

The following example downcasts a `ConnectApi.MessageSegment` to a `ConnectApi.MentionSegment`:

```apex
if(segment instanceof ConnectApi.MentionSegment) {
	ConnectApi.MentionSegment = (ConnectApi.MentionSegment)segment;
}
```

:::tip Important
The composition of a feed can change between
            releases. Write your code to handle instances of unknown subclasses.
