# DataWeave in Apex

DataWeave in Apex uses the Mulesoft DataWeave library to read and parse data from one format, transform it, and export it in a different format. You can create DataWeave scripts as metadata and invoke them directly from Apex. Like Apex, DataWeave scripts are run within Salesforce application servers, enforcing the same heap and CPU limits on the executing code.

Enterprise applications often require transformation of data between formats such as CSV, JSON, XML, and Apex objects. DataWeave in Apex complements native Apex support for JSON and XML processing, and makes data transformation easier to code, more scalable, and efficient. Apex developers can focus more on solving business problems and less on addressing the specifics of file formats.

DataWeave is the MuleSoft expression language for accessing, parsing, and transforming data that travels through a Mule application. For detailed information, see [DataWeave Overview](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/dataweave "HTML (New Window)"). 

:::tip Note
You don’t have to be a MuleSoft customer or have any specific Salesforce license to
            use DataWeave in Apex.
:::

The following are some use-cases for DataWeave in Apex.

-   Serializing Apex objects with custom date formats
-   Serializing and deserializing JSON with Apex reserved keywords
-   Performing custom transformations like removing or adding namespaces or removing `__c` suffixes
-   Parsing and transforming RFC 4180-compliant CSV (Comma-Separated Values) data

You can create a listview for DataWeave resources in your org and view deployed DataWeave scripts within your namespace. From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter DataWeave, and then select **DataWeave Resources**. Select the fields that you want to monitor, such as the DataWeave Resource ID, Name, Namespace Prefix, and API Version.
