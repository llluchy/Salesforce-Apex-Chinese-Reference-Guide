# Execution Governors and Limits

Because Apex runs in a multitenant environment, the Apex runtime engine strictly enforces limits so that runaway Apex code or processes don’t monopolize shared resources. If some Apex code exceeds a limit, the associated governor issues a runtime exception that can’t be handled.

The Apex limits, or **governors**, track, and enforce the statistics outlined in the following tables and sections.

-   [Per-Transaction Apex Limits](#in_topic_per_transaction_section)
-   [Per-Transaction Certified Managed Package Limits](#in_topic_per_transaction_cert_pkg_limits_section)
-   [Salesforce Platform Apex Limits](#in_topic_non_transactional_gov_limits_section)
-   [Static Apex Limits](#in_topic_static_gov_limits_section)
-   [Size-Specific Apex Limits](#in_topic_size_gov_limits_section)
-   [Miscellaneous Apex Limits](#in_topic_misc_limits_section)

In addition to the core Apex governor limits, [email limits](#in_topic_email_limits_section) and [push notification limits](#in_topic_push_notification_section) are also included later in this topic for your convenience.

## Per-Transaction Apex Limits

These limits count for each Apex transaction. For Batch Apex, these limits are reset for each execution of a batch of records in the `execute` method.

This table lists limits for synchronous Apex and asynchronous Apex (Batch Apex and future methods) when they’re different. Otherwise, this table lists only one limit that applies to both synchronous and asynchronous Apex.

:::tip Note
- Although scheduled Apex is an asynchronous feature, synchronous limits apply to
            scheduled Apex jobs.

          - For Bulk API and Bulk API 2.0 transactions, the effective limit is the higher of the
            synchronous and asynchronous limits. For example, the maximum number of Bulk Apex jobs
            added to the queue with `System.enqueueJob` is the
            synchronous limit (50), which is higher than the asynchronous limit (1).
:::

| Description | Synchronous Limit | Asynchronous Limit |

1 In a SOQL query with parent-child relationship subqueries, each parent-child relationship counts as an extra query. These types of queries have a limit of three times the number for top-level queries. The limit for subqueries corresponds to the value that `Limits.getLimitAggregateQueries()` returns. The row counts from these relationship queries contribute to the row counts of the overall code execution. This limit doesn’t apply to custom metadata types. In a single Apex transaction, custom metadata records can have unlimited SOQL queries. In addition to static SOQL statements, calls to the following methods count against the number of SOQL statements issued in a request.

-   `Database.countQuery`, `Database.countQueryWithBinds`
-   `Database.getQueryLocator`, `Database.getQueryLocatorWithBinds`
-   `Database.query`, `Database.queryWithBinds`

2 Calls to the following methods count against the number of DML statements issued in a request.

-   `Approval.process`
-   `Database.convertLead`
-   `Database.emptyRecycleBin`
-   `Database.rollback`
-   `Database.setSavePoint`
-   `delete` and `Database.delete`
-   `insert` and `Database.insert`
-   `merge` and `Database.merge`
-   `undelete` and `Database.undelete`
-   `update` and `Database.update`
-   `upsert` and `Database.upsert`
-   `EventBus.publish` for platform events configured to publish after commit
-   `System.runAs`

3 Recursive Apex that doesn’t fire any triggers with `insert`, `update`, or `delete` statements, exists in a single invocation, with a single stack. Conversely, recursive Apex that fires a trigger spawns the trigger in a new Apex invocation. The new invocation is separate from the invocation of the code that caused it to fire. Spawning a new invocation of Apex is a more expensive operation than a recursive call in a single invocation. Therefore, there are tighter restrictions on the stack depth of these types of recursive calls.

4 Email services heap size is 50 MB.

5 CPU time is calculated for all executions on the Salesforce application servers occurring in one Apex transaction. CPU time is calculated for the executing Apex code, and for any processes that are called from this code, such as package code and workflows. CPU time is private for a transaction and is isolated from other transactions. Application server CPU time spent in DML operations is counted towards the Apex CPU limit. Operations that don't consume application server CPU time aren't counted toward CPU time. For example, the portion of execution time spent in the database for DML, SOQL, and SOSL isn't counted, nor is waiting time for Apex callouts. Bulk API and Bulk API 2.0 consume a unique governor limit for CPU time on Salesforce Servers, with a maximum value of 60,000 milliseconds.

:::tip Note
- Limits apply individually to each `testMethod`.

          - To determine the code execution limits for your code while it’s running, use the
            Limits methods. For example, you can use the `getDMLStatements` method to determine the number of DML statements that have
            already been called by your program. Or, you can use the `getLimitDMLStatements` method to determine the total number of DML statements
            available to your code.

## Per-Transaction Certified Managed Package Limits

Certified managed packages—managed packages that have passed the security review for AppExchange—get their own set of limits for most per-transaction limits. Salesforce ISV Partners develop certified managed packages, which are installed in your org from AppExchange and have unique namespaces.

Here’s an example that illustrates the separate certified managed package limits for DML statements. If you install a certified managed package, all the Apex code in that package gets its own 150 DML statements. These DML statements are in addition to the 150 DML statements your org’s native code can execute. This limit increase means that more than 150 DML statements can execute during a single transaction if code from the managed package and your native org both executes. Similarly, the certified managed package gets its own 100-SOQL-query limit for synchronous Apex, in addition to the org’s native code limit of 100 SOQL queries.

There’s no limit on the number of certified namespaces that can be invoked in a single transaction. However, the number of operations that can be performed in each namespace must not exceed the per-transaction limits. There’s also a limit on the cumulative number of operations that can be made across namespaces in a transaction. This cumulative limit is 11 times the per-namespace limit. For example, if the per-namespace limit for SOQL queries is 100, a single transaction can perform up to 1,100 SOQL queries. In this case, the cumulative limit is 11 times the per-namespace limit of 100. These queries can be performed across an unlimited number of namespaces, as long as any one namespace doesn't have more than 100 queries. The cumulative limit doesn’t affect limits that are shared across all namespaces, such as the limit on maximum CPU time.

:::tip Note
- These cross-namespace limits apply only to namespaces in certified managed
            packages.

          - Namespaces in non-certified packages don’t have their own separate governor limits.
            The resources that they use continue to count against the same governor limits used by
            the org's custom code.
:::

This table lists the cumulative cross-namespace limits.

| Description | Cumulative Cross-Namespace Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Total number of SOQL queries issued | 1,100 |
| Total number of records retrieved by `Database.getQueryLocator` | 110,000 |
| Total number of SOSL queries issued | 220 |
| Total number of DML statements issued | 1,650 |
| Total number of callouts (HTTP requests or web services calls) in a transaction | 1,100 |
| Total number of `sendEmail` methods allowed | 110 |

All per-transaction limits count separately for certified managed packages except for:

-   The total heap size
-   The maximum CPU time
-   The maximum transaction execution time
-   The maximum number of unique namespaces

These limits count for the entire transaction, regardless of how many certified managed packages are running in the same transaction.

The code from a package from AppExchange, not created by a Salesforce ISV Partner and not certified, doesn’t have its own separate governor limits. Any resources used by the package count against the total org governor limits. Cumulative resource messages and warning emails are also generated based on managed package namespaces.

## Salesforce Platform Apex Limits

The limits in this table aren't specific to an Apex transaction; the Salesforce Platform enforces these limits.

| Description | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| The maximum number of asynchronous Apex method executions (batch Apex, future methods, Queueable Apex, and scheduled Apex) per a 24-hour period. This licensed daily limit is the `DailyAsyncApexExecutions` org limit.1,6,7 | 250,000 or the number of applicable user licenses in your org multiplied by 200, whichever is greater |
| The total number of Queueable Apex and future method executions that can be enqueued during a 24-hour period, including elastic executions processed at a throttled rate (beta). This limit is the `DailyAsyncApexElasticExecutions` org limit.6 | The org’s daily asynchronous Apex method executions limit plus either the org’s licensed daily asynchronous Apex method executions limit or 10 million executions, whichever is less.
In other words, the extra elastic executions added to the daily asynchronous Apex method executions limit is capped at a maximum of 10 million additional executions.

 |
| Maximum number of Apex cursors per day | 10,000 |
| Maximum cumulative number of new cursor rows and pagination cursor rows per 24-hour period | 100 million |
| Maximum number of Apex pagination cursor instances per 24-hour period | 200,000 |
| Number of synchronous concurrent transactions for long-running transactions that last longer than 5 seconds for each org.2 | Based on the number of applicable licenses8 in an org, the limit is calculated as a ratio of 100 licenses to one concurrent long-running Apex transaction9.

-   Minimum limit is 10
-   Maximum limit is 50

 |
| Maximum number of Apex classes scheduled concurrently | 100\. In Developer Edition orgs, the limit is 5. |
| Maximum number of batch Apex jobs in the Apex flex queue that are in `Holding` status | 100 |
| Maximum number of batch Apex jobs queued or active concurrently3 | 5 |
| Maximum number of batch Apex job `start` method concurrent executions4 | 1 |
| Maximum number of batch jobs that can be submitted in a running test | 5 |
| Maximum number of test classes that can be queued per 24-hour period (production orgs other than Developer Edition)5,6 | The greater of 500 or 10 multiplied by the number of test classes in the org |
| Maximum number of test classes that can be queued per 24-hour period (sandbox and Developer Edition orgs)5,6 | The greater of 500 or 20 multiplied by the number of test classes in the org |

1 For Batch Apex, method executions include executions of the `start`, `execute`, and `finish` methods. This limit is for your entire org and is shared with all asynchronous Apex: Batch Apex, Queueable Apex, scheduled Apex, and future methods. The license types that count toward this limit include full Salesforce and Salesforce Platform user licenses, App Subscription user licenses, Chatter Only users, Identity users, and Company Communities users.

2 If more transactions are started while the default number of long-running transactions are still running, they’re denied. HTTP callout processing time isn’t included when calculating this limit.

3 When batch jobs are submitted, they’re held in the flex queue before the system queues them for processing.

4 Batch jobs that haven’t started yet remain in the queue until they’re started. If more than one job is running, this limit doesn’t cause any batch job to fail.`execute` methods of batch Apex jobs still run in parallel.

5 This limit applies to tests running asynchronously. This group of tests includes tests started through the Salesforce user interface including the Developer Console or by inserting `ApexTestQueueItem` objects using SOAP API.

6 To check how many asynchronous Apex executions are available, make a request to REST API `limits` resource or use Apex methods `OrgLimits.getAll()` or `OrgLimits.getMap()`. See [List Organization Limits](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_limits.htm "HTML (New Window)") in the *REST API Developer Guide* and [OrgLimits Class](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_System_OrgLimits.htm) in the *Apex Reference Guide*.

7 If the number of asynchronous Apex executions needed by a job exceeds the available number that’s calculated using the 24-hour rolling limit, an exception is thrown. Batch Apex preemptively checks the required asynchronous job capacity when `Database.executeBatch` is called and the `start` method has returned the workload. The batch won’t start unless there is sufficient capacity for the entire job available. For example, if the batch requires 10,000 executions and the remaining asynchronous limit is 9,500 executions, an `AsyncApexExecutions Limit exceeded` exception is thrown, and the remaining executions are left unchanged.

8 The license types that count toward this limit include full Salesforce and Salesforce Platform user licenses, App Subscription user licenses, Chatter Only users, Identity users, and Company Communities users.

9 For example, if your org has 4,000 licenses, the concurrent long-running Apex requests limit is set at 40. If your org has 5,000 or more licenses, the concurrent long-running Apex requests limit is set at 50, which is the maximum capped limit. If your org has 1,000 or fewer licenses, the concurrent long-running Apex requests limit is set at 10, which is the minimum floor limit.

## Static Apex Limits

| Description | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Default timeout of callouts (HTTP requests or Web services calls) in a transaction | 10 seconds |
| Maximum size of callout request or response (HTTP request or Web services call)1 | 6 MB for synchronous Apex or 12 MB for asynchronous Apex |
| Maximum SOQL query run time before Salesforce cancels the transaction | 120 seconds |
| Maximum number of class and trigger code units in a deployment of Apex | 7500 |
| Apex trigger batch size2 | 200 |
| For loop list batch size | 200 |
| Maximum number of records returned for a Batch Apex query in `Database.QueryLocator` | 50 million |

1 The HTTP request and response sizes count towards the total heap size.

2 The Apex trigger batch size for platform events and Change Data Capture events is 2,000. The trigger batch size doesn’t apply when using [Mass Transfer Records](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.admin_transfer.htm&type=5&language=en_US).

## Size-Specific Apex Limits

| Description | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum number of characters for a class | 1 million |
| Maximum number of characters for a trigger | 1 million |
| Maximum amount of code used by all Apex code in an org1 ,3 ,4 | 6 MB |
| Method size limit2 | 65,535 bytecode instructions in compiled form |

1 This limit doesn’t apply to Apex code in first generation(1GP) or second generation(2GP) managed packages. The code in those types of packages belongs to a namespace unique from the code in your org. This limit also doesn’t apply to any code included in a class defined with the [`@isTest` annotation](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_annotation_isTest.htm "Use the @IsTest annotation to define classes and methods that only contain code used for testing your app.").

2 Large methods that exceed the allowed limit cause an exception to be thrown during the execution of your code.

3 The default 6 MB limit can be increased by opening a [support case](https://help.salesforce.com/s/) for your org. Before you apply for a limit increase, ensure that you’re following best practices outlined in [Increase Apex Code Character Limit](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000382172&type=1&language=en_US).

4 For scratch orgs, the limit is 10MB. The limit can be increased by opening a [support case](https://help.salesforce.com/s/) for your org. Before you apply for a limit increase, ensure that you’re following the [best practices](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000382172&type=1&language=en_US).

## Miscellaneous Apex Limits

Connect in Apex

For classes in the `ConnectApi` namespace, every write operation costs one DML statement against the Apex governor limit. `ConnectApi` method calls are also subject to rate limits. Most `ConnectApi` method calls count toward the [Salesforce Platform total API request allocations](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet.meta/salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet/salesforce_app_limits_platform_api.htm), which are per org and span a 24-hour period. Only `ConnectApi` method calls that require Chatter are subject to a per user, per namespace, per hour rate limit. The documentation for every `ConnectApi` method indicates whether Chatter is required. When you exceed the rate limit, a `ConnectApi.RateLimitException` is thrown. Your Apex code must catch and handle this exception.

Data.com Clean

If you use the Data.com Clean product and its automated jobs, consider how you use Apex triggers. If you have Apex triggers on account, contact, or lead records that run SOQL queries, the SOQL queries can interfere with Clean jobs for those objects. Your Apex triggers (combined) must not exceed 200 SOQL queries per batch. If they do, your Clean job for that object fails. In addition, if your triggers call `future` methods, they’re subject to a limit of 10 `future` calls per batch.

Event Reports

The maximum number of records that an event report returns for a user who isn’t a system administrator is 20,000; for system administrators, 100,000.

MAX\_DML\_ROWS limit in Apex testing

The maximum number of rows that can be inserted, updated, or deleted, in a single, synchronous Apex test execution context, is limited to 450,000. For example, an Apex class can have 45 methods that insert 10,000 rows each. If the limit is reached, you see this error: `Your runallTests is consuming too many DB resources`.

SOQL Query Performance

For best performance, use selective SOQL queries. This is especially important for queries inside triggers. See [More Efficient SOQL Queries](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/langCon_apex_SOQL_VLSQ.htm).

## Email Limits

Inbound Email Limits

<table class="featureTable sort_table" summary=""><tbody class="tbody"><tr><td class="entry">Email Services: Maximum Number of Email Messages Processed<p class="p">(Includes limit for On-Demand Email-to-Case)</p></td><td class="entry">Number of user licenses multiplied by 1,000; maximum 1,000,000</td></tr><tr><td class="entry">Email Services: Maximum Size of Email Message (Body and Attachments)</td><td class="entry">25 MB<sup class="ph sup">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td class="entry">On-Demand Email-to-Case: Maximum Email Attachment Size</td><td class="entry">25 MB</td></tr><tr><td class="entry">On-Demand Email-to-Case: Maximum Number of Email Messages Processed<p class="p">(Counts toward limit for Email Services)</p></td><td class="entry">Number of user licenses multiplied by 1,000; maximum 1,000,000</td></tr></tbody></table>

1 The maximum size of email messages for Email Services varies depending on the character set and transfer encoding of the body parts. The size of an email message includes the email headers, body, attachments, and encoding. As a result, an email with a 35-MB attachment likely exceeds the 25-MB size limit for an email message after accounting for the headers, body, and encoding.

When defining email services, note the following:

-   An email service only processes messages it receives at one of its addresses.
-   Salesforce limits the total number of messages that all email services combined, including On-Demand Email-to-Case, can process daily. Messages that exceed this limit are bounced, discarded, or queued for processing the next day, depending on how you configure the failure response settings for each email service. Salesforce calculates the limit by multiplying the number of user licenses by 1,000; maximum 1,000,000. For example, if you have 10 licenses, your org can process up to 10,000 email messages a day.
-   Email service addresses that you create in your sandbox can’t be copied to your production org.
-   For each email service, you can tell Salesforce to send error email messages to a specified address instead of the sender's email address.
-   Email services reject email messages and notify the sender if the email (combined body text, body HTML, and attachments) exceeds approximately 25 MB (varies depending on language and character set).

Outbound Email: Limits for Single and Mass Email Sent Using Apex

Each licensed org can send single emails to a maximum of 5,000 external email addresses per day based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). For orgs created before Spring ’19, the daily limit is enforced only for emails sent via Apex and Salesforce APIs except for REST API. For orgs created in Spring ’19 and later, the daily limit is also enforced for email alerts, simple email actions, Send Email actions in flows, and REST API. If one of the newly counted emails can’t be sent because your org has reached the limit, we notify you by email and add an entry to the debug logs. Single emails sent using the email author or composer in Salesforce don't count toward this limit. There’s no limit on sending single emails to contacts, leads, person accounts, and users in your org directly from account, contact, lead, opportunity, case, campaign, or custom object pages. In Developer Edition orgs and orgs evaluating Salesforce during a trial period, you can send to a maximum of 50 recipients per day, and each single email can have up to 15 recipients.

Keep these considerations in mind when sending emails:

-   When sending single emails, you can specify up to 150 recipients across the To, CC, and BCC fields in each SingleEmailMessage. Each field is also limited to 4,000 bytes.
-   If you use SingleEmailMessage to email your org’s internal users, specifying the user’s ID in setTargetObjectId means the email doesn’t count toward the daily limit. However, specifying internal users’ email addresses in setToAddresses means the email does count toward the limit.

-   You can send mass email and list email to a maximum of 5,000 external email addresses per day per licensed Salesforce org. A day is calculated based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
-   The single email, mass email, and list email limits count duplicate email addresses. For example, if you have johndoe@example.com in your email 10 times that counts as 10 against the limit.
-   API or Apex single emails can be sent to a maximum of 5,000 external email addresses per day.
-   You can send an unlimited amount of email through the UI to your org’s internal users, which include portal users.
-   You can send mass emails and list emails only to contacts, person accounts, leads, and your org’s internal users.
-   In Developer Edition orgs and orgs evaluating Salesforce during a trial period, you can send to no more than 10 external email recipients per org per day using mass email and list email.
-   You can’t send mass email using a Visualforce email template.

## Push Notification Limits

An org can send up to 20,000 iOS and 10,000 Android push notifications per hour (for example, 4:00 to 4:59 UTC).

Only *deliverable* notifications count toward this limit. For example, a notification is sent to 1,000 employees in your company, but 100 employees haven’t installed the mobile app yet. Only the notifications sent to the 900 employees who have installed the mobile app count toward this limit.

Each test push notification that is generated through the Test Push Notification page is limited to a single recipient. Test push notifications count toward an org’s hourly push notification limit.

When an org's hourly push notification limit is met, any additional notifications are still created for in-app display and retrieval via REST API.
