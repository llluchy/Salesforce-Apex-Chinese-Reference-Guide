# Pattern and Matcher Example

The Matcher class `end` method returns the position in the match string after the last character that was matched. You would use this when you are parsing a string and want to do additional work with it after you have found a match, such as find the next match.

In regular expression syntax, `?` means match once or not at all, and `+` means match 1 or more times.

In the following example, the string passed in with the Matcher object matches the pattern since `(a(b)?)` matches the string `'ab'` - `'a'` followed by `'b'` once. It then matches the last `'a'` - `'a'` followed by `'b'` not at all.

```apex
pattern myPattern = pattern.compile('(a(b)?)+'); 
matcher myMatcher = myPattern.matcher('aba');
System.assert(myMatcher.matches() && myMatcher.hitEnd());

// We have two groups: group 0 is always the whole pattern, and group 1 contains 
// the substring that most recently matched--in this case, 'a'. 
// So the following is true:

System.assert(myMatcher.groupCount() == 2 &&
              myMatcher.group(0) == 'aba' && 
              myMatcher.group(1) == 'a');
 
// Since group 0 refers to the whole pattern, the following is true:

System.assert(myMatcher.end() == myMatcher.end(0));

// Since the offset after the last character matched is returned by end, 
// and since both groups used the last input letter, that offset is 3
// Remember the offset starts its count at 0. So the following is also true:

System.assert(myMatcher.end() == 3 && 
              myMatcher.end(0) == 3 && 
              myMatcher.end(1) == 3);
```

In the following example, email addresses are normalized and duplicates are reported if there is a different top-level domain name or subdomain for similar email addresses. For example, `john@fairway.smithco` is normalized to `john@smithco`.

```apex
class normalizeEmailAddresses{

    public void hasDuplicatesByDomain(Lead[] leads) {
           // This pattern reduces the email address to 'john@smithco' 
           // from 'john@*.smithco.com' or 'john@smithco.*'
        Pattern emailPattern = Pattern.compile('(?                                               [\\w]+\\.)|(\\.[\\w]+$)');
           // Define a set for emailkey to lead:
        MapString,Lead> leadMap = new MapString,Lead>();
                for(Lead lead:leads) {
                    // Ignore leads with a null email
                    if(lead.Email != null) {
                           // Generate the key using the regular expression
                       String emailKey = emailPattern.matcher(lead.Email).replaceAll('');
                           // Look for duplicates in the batch
                       if(leadMap.containsKey(emailKey)) 
                            lead.email.addError('Duplicate found in batch');
                       else {
                           // Keep the key in the duplicate key custom field
                            lead.Duplicate_Key__c = emailKey;
                            leadMap.put(emailKey, lead);
                       }
                 }
             }
                // Now search the database looking for duplicates 
                for(Lead[] leadsCheck:[SELECT Id, duplicate_key__c FROM Lead WHERE 
                duplicate_key__c IN :leadMap.keySet()]) {
               for(Lead lead:leadsCheck) {
               // If there's a duplicate, add the error.
                   if(leadMap.containsKey(lead.Duplicate_Key__c)) 
                      leadMap.get(lead.Duplicate_Key__c).email.addError('Duplicate found 
                         in salesforce(Id: ' + lead.Id + ')');
            }
        }
    }
 }
```
