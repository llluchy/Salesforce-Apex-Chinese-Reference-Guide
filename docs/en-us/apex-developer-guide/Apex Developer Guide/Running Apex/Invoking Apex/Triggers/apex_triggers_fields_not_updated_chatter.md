# Triggers for Chatter Objects

You can write triggers for the FeedItem and FeedComment objects.

## Trigger Considerations for FeedItem, FeedAttachment, and FeedComment

-   Only FeedItems of type `TextPost`, `QuestionPost`, `LinkPost`, `HasLink`, `ContentPost`, and `HasContent` can be inserted, and therefore invoke the `before` or `after insert` trigger. User status updates don't cause the FeedItem triggers to fire.
-   While FeedPost objects were supported for API versions 18.0, 19.0, and 20.0, don't use any insert or delete triggers saved against versions before 21.0.
-   For FeedItem, the following fields aren’t available in the `before insert` trigger:
    
    -   ContentSize
    -   ContentType
    
    In addition, the ContentData field isn’t available in any delete trigger.
    
-   Triggers on FeedItem objects run before their attachment and capabilities information is saved, which means that `ConnectApi.FeedItem.attachment` information and `ConnectApi.FeedElement.capabilities` information may not be available in the trigger.
    
    The attachment and capabilities information may not be available from these methods: `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.getFeedItem`, `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.getFeedElement`, `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.getFeedPoll`, `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.getFeedElementPoll`, `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.postFeedItem`, `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.postFeedElement`, `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.shareFeedItem`, `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.shareFeedElement`, `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.voteOnFeedPoll`, and `ConnectApi.ChatterFeeds.voteOnFeedElementPoll`
    
-   FeedAttachment isn’t a triggerable object. You can access feed attachments in FeedItem *update* triggers through a SOQL query. For example:

```apex
trigger FeedItemTrigger on FeedItem (after update) {

    List attachments =  [SELECT Id, Title, Type, FeedEntityId 
                                         FROM FeedAttachment 
                                         WHERE FeedEntityId IN :Trigger.new ];
    
    for (FeedAttachment attachment : attachments) {
        System.debug(attachment.Type);
    }
}
```

-   When you insert a feed item with associated attachments, the FeedItem is inserted first, then the FeedAttachment records are created. On update of a feed item with associated attachments, the FeedAttachment records are inserted first, then the FeedItem is updated. As a result of this sequence of operations, in Salesforce Classic FeedAttachment is available in `Update` and `AfterInsert` triggers. When the attachment is done through Lightning Experience, it’s available in both the `Update` and `AfterInsert` triggers; but in the `AfterInsert` trigger, use the future method to access FeedAttachments.
-   The following feed attachment operations cause the FeedItem *update* triggers to fire.
    -   A FeedAttachment is added to a FeedItem and causes the FeedItem type to change.
    -   A FeedAttachment is removed from a FeedItem and causes the FeedItem type to change.
-   FeedItem triggers aren’t fired when inserting or updating a FeedAttachment that doesn’t cause a change on the associated FeedItem.
-   You can’t insert, update, or delete FeedAttachments in *before update* and *after update* FeedItem triggers.
-   For FeedComment *before insert* and *after insert* triggers, the fields of a ContentVersion associated with the FeedComment (obtained through `FeedComment.RelatedRecordId`) aren’t available.

## Other Chatter Trigger Considerations

-   Apex code uses extra security when executing in a Chatter context. To post to a private group, the user running the code must be a member of that group. If the running user isn't a member, you can set the CreatedById field to be a member of the group in the FeedItem record.
-   When CollaborationGroupMember is updated, CollaborationGroup is automatically updated as well to ensure that the member count is correct. As a result, when CollaborationGroupMember `update` or `delete` triggers run, CollaborationGroup `update` triggers run as well.
