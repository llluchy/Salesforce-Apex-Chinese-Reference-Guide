# Trigger Context Variables

All triggers define implicit variables that allow developers to access run-time context. These variables are contained in the `System.Trigger` class.

Here are the trigger context variables.

| Variable | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `isExecuting` | Returns `true` if the current context for the Apex code is a trigger, not a Visualforce page, a web service, or an `executeanonymous()` API call. |
| `isInsert` | Returns `true` if this trigger was fired due to an insert operation, from the Salesforce user interface, Apex, or the API. |
| `isUpdate` | Returns `true` if this trigger was fired due to an update operation, from the Salesforce user interface, Apex, or the API. |
| `isDelete` | Returns `true` if this trigger was fired due to a delete operation, from the Salesforce user interface, Apex, or the API. |
| `isBefore` | Returns `true` if this trigger was fired before any record was saved. |
| `isAfter` | Returns `true` if this trigger was fired after all records were saved. |
| `isUndelete` | Returns `true` if this trigger was fired after a record is recovered from the Recycle Bin. This recovery can occur after an undelete operation from the Salesforce user interface, Apex, or the API. |
| `new` | Returns a list of the new versions of the sObject records.
This sObject list is only available in `insert`, `update`, and `undelete` triggers, and the records can only be modified in `before` triggers.

 |
| `newMap` | A map of IDs to the new versions of the sObject records.

This map is only available in `before update`, `after insert`, `after update`, and `after undelete` triggers.

 |
| `old` | Returns a list of the old versions of the sObject records.

This sObject list is only available in `update` and `delete` triggers.

 |
| `oldMap` | A map of IDs to the old versions of the sObject records.

This map is only available in `update` and `delete` triggers.

 |
| `operationType` | Returns an enum of type `System.TriggerOperation` corresponding to the current operation.

Possible values of the System.TriggerOperation enum are: `BEFORE_INSERT`, `BEFORE_UPDATE`, `BEFORE_DELETE`,`AFTER_INSERT`, `AFTER_UPDATE`, `AFTER_DELETE`, and `AFTER_UNDELETE`. If you vary your programming logic based on different trigger types, consider using the `switch` statement with different permutations of unique trigger execution enum states.

 |
| `size` | The number of records processed in a trigger invocation. DML operations that include over 200 records are processed in batches, and the trigger is invoked for each batch. `Trigger.size` includes only the number of records in the current batch, not the total number of records in the DML operation. |

:::tip Note
The record firing a trigger can include an invalid field
            value, such as a formula that divides by zero. In this case, the field value is set to
                `null` in these variables: 
                - `new`

                - `newMap`

                - `old`

                - `oldMap`
:::

For example, in this simple trigger, `Trigger.new` is a list of sObjects and can be iterated over in a `for` loop. It can also be used as a bind variable in the `IN` clause of a SOQL query.

```apex
trigger SimpleTrigger on Account(after insert) {
  for (Account a : Trigger.new) {
    // Iterate over each sObject
  }

  // This single query finds every contact that is associated with any of the
  // triggering accounts. Note that although Trigger.new is a collection of
  // records, when used as a bind variable in a SOQL query, Apex automatically
  // transforms the list of records into a list of corresponding Ids.
  Contact[] cons = [
    SELECT LastName
    FROM Contact
    WHERE AccountId IN :Trigger.new
    WITH USER_MODE
  ];
}
```

This trigger uses Boolean context variables such as `Trigger.isBefore` and `Trigger.isDelete` to define code that only executes for specific trigger conditions:

```apex
trigger MyAccountTrigger on Account(
  before delete,
  before insert,
  before update,
  after delete,
  after insert,
  after update
) {
  if (Trigger.isBefore) {
    if (Trigger.isDelete) {
      // In a before delete trigger, the trigger accesses the records that will be
      // deleted with the Trigger.old list.
      for (Account a : Trigger.old) {
        if (a.name != 'okToDelete') {
          a.addError('You can\'t delete this record!');
        }
      }
    } else {
      // In before insert or before update triggers, the trigger accesses the new records
      // with the Trigger.new list.
      for (Account a : Trigger.new) {
        if (a.name == 'bad') {
          a.name.addError('Bad name');
        }
      }
      if (Trigger.isInsert) {
        for (Account a : Trigger.new) {
          Assert.areEqual('xxx', a.accountNumber);
          Assert.areEqual('industry', a.industry);
          Assert.areEqual(100, a.numberofemployees);
          Assert.areEqual(100.0, a.annualrevenue);
          a.accountNumber = 'yyy';
        }

        // If the trigger is not a before trigger, it must be an after trigger.
      } else {
        if (Trigger.isInsert) {
          List contacts = new List();
          for (Account a : Trigger.new) {
            if (a.Name == 'makeContact') {
              contacts.add(new Contact(LastName = a.Name, AccountId = a.Id));
            }
          }
          insert as user contacts;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
