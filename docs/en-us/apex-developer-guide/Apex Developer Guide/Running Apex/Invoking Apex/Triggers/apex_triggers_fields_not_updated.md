# Entity and Field Considerations in Triggers

When you create triggers, consider the behavior of certain entities, fields, and operations.

## QuestionDataCategorySelection Entity Not Available in After Insert Triggers

The `after insert` trigger that fires after inserting one or more `Question` records doesn’t have access to the `QuestionDataCategorySelection` records that are associated with the inserted `Question`s. For example, the following query doesn’t return any results in an `after insert` trigger:

```apex
QuestionDataCategorySelection[] dcList = 
    [select Id,DataCategoryName from QuestionDataCategorySelection where ParentId IN :questions];
```

## Fields Not Updateable in Before Triggers

Some field values are set during the system save operation, which occurs after `before` triggers have fired. As a result, these fields cannot be modified or accurately detected in `before insert` or `before update` triggers. Some examples include:

-   `Task.isClosed`
-   `Opportunity.amount`\*
-   `Opportunity.ForecastCategory`
-   `Opportunity.isWon`
-   `Opportunity.isClosed`
-   `Contract.activatedDate`
-   `Contract.activatedById`
-   `Case.isClosed`
-   `Solution.isReviewed`
-   `Id` (for all records)\*\*
-   `createdDate` (for all records)\*\*
-   `lastUpdated` (for all records)
-   `Event.WhoId` (when Shared Activities is enabled)
-   `Task.WhoId` (when Shared Activities is enabled)

\* When `Opportunity` has no `lineitems`, `Amount` can be modified by a `before` trigger.

\*\* `Id` and `createdDate` can be detected in `before update` triggers, but cannot be modified.

## Fields Not Updateable in After Triggers

The following fields can’t be updated by `after insert` or `after update` triggers.

-   `Event.WhoId`
-   `Task.WhoId`

## Considerations for Event DateTime Fields in Insert and Update Triggers

We recommend using the following date and time fields to create or update events.

-   When creating or updating a timed Event, use `ActivityDateTime` to avoid issues with inconsistent date and time values.
-   When creating or updating an all-day Event, use `ActivityDate` to avoid issues with inconsistent date and time values.
-   We recommend that you use `DurationInMinutes` because it works with all updates and creates for Events.

## Operations Not Supported in Insert and Update Triggers

The following operations aren’t supported in `insert` and `update` triggers.

-   Manipulating an activity relation through the `TaskRelation` or `EventRelation` object, if Shared Activities is enabled
-   Manipulating an invitee relation on a group event through the `Invitee` object, whether or not Shared Activities is enabled

## Entities Not Supported in After Undelete Triggers

Certain objects can’t be restored, and therefore, shouldn’t have `after undelete` triggers.

-   CollaborationGroup
-   CollaborationGroupMember
-   FeedItem
-   FeedComment

## Considerations for Update Triggers

Field history tracking honors the permissions of the current user. If the current user doesn’t have permission to directly edit an object or field, but the user activates a trigger that changes an object or field with history tracking enabled, no history of the change is recorded.

## Considerations for the Salesforce Side Panel for Salesforce for Outlook

When an email is associated to a record using the Salesforce Side Panel for Salesforce for Outlook, the email associations are represented in the `WhoId` or `WhatId` fields on a task record. Associations are completed after the task is created, so the `Task.WhoId` and `Task.WhatId` fields aren’t immediately available in `before` or `after` Task triggers for insert and update events, and their values are initially `null`. The `WhoId` and `WhatId` fields are set on the saved task record in a subsequent operation, however, so their values can be retrieved later.
