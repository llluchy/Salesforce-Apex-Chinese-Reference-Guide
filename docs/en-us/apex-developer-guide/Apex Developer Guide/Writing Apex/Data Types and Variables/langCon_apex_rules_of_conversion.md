# Rules of Conversion

In general, Apex requires you to explicitly convert one data type to another. For example, a variable of the Integer data type cannot be implicitly converted to a String. You must use the `string.format` method. However, a few data types can be implicitly converted, without using a method.

Numbers form a hierarchy of types. Variables of lower numeric types can always be assigned to higher types without explicit conversion. The following is the hierarchy for numbers, from lowest to highest:

1.  Integer
2.  Long
3.  Double
4.  Decimal

:::tip Note
Once a value has been passed from a number of a lower type to a number of a higher
            type, the value is converted to the higher type of number.
:::

Note that the hierarchy and implicit conversion is unlike the Java hierarchy of numbers, where the base interface number is used and implicit object conversion is never allowed.

In addition to numbers, other data types can be implicitly converted. The following rules apply:

-   IDs can always be assigned to Strings.
-   Strings can be assigned to IDs. However, at runtime, the value is checked to ensure that it is a legitimate ID. If it is not, a runtime exception is thrown.
-   The `instanceOf` keyword can always be used to test whether a string is an ID.

## Additional Considerations for Data Types

-   **Data Types of Numeric Values**: Numeric values represent Integer values unless they are appended with L for a Long or with .0 for a Double or Decimal. For example, the expression `Long d = 123;` declares a Long variable named d and assigns it to an Integer numeric value (123), which is implicitly converted to a Long. The Integer value on the right hand side is within the range for Integers and the assignment succeeds. However, if the numeric value on the right hand side exceeds the maximum value for an Integer, you get a compilation error. In this case, the solution is to append L to the numeric value so that it represents a Long value which has a wider range, as shown in this example: `Long d = 2147483648L;`.
-   **Overflow and Underflow of Data Type Values**: Arithmetic computations that produce values larger than the maximum value of the current type are said to overflow and values lower than the minimum value of the current type are said to be underflow. Apex doesn’t throw an exception for overflow and underflow of data type values. For example, `Integer i = 2147483647 + 1;` yields a value of –2147483648 because 2147483647 is the maximum value for an Integer, so adding one to it wraps the value around to the minimum negative value for Integers: –2147483648. Similarly, subtracting one from the minimum integer -2,147,483,648 wraps the value around to the maximum value for Integers: 2,147,483,647. If arithmetic computations generate results larger than the maximum value for the current type, the end result will be incorrect because the computed values that are larger than the maximum will overflow. For example, the expression `Long MillsPerYear = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;` results in an incorrect result because the products of Integers on the right hand side are larger than the maximum Integer value and they overflow. As a result, the final product isn't the expected one. You can avoid this by ensuring that the type of numeric values or variables you are using in arithmetic operations are large enough to hold the results. In this example, append L to numeric values to make them Long so the intermediate products will be Long as well and no overflow occurs. The following example shows how to correctly compute the amount of milliseconds in a year by multiplying Long numeric values.

```apex
Long MillsPerYear = 365L * 24L * 60L * 60L * 1000L;
Long ExpectedValue = 31536000000L;
System.assertEquals(MillsPerYear, ExpectedValue);
```

-   **Loss of Fractions in Divisions**: When dividing numeric Integer or Long values, the fractional portion of the result, if any, is removed before performing any implicit conversions to a Double or Decimal. For example, `Double d = 5/3;` returns 1.0 because the actual result (1.666...) is an Integer and is rounded to 1 before being implicitly converted to a Double. To preserve the fractional value, ensure that you are using Double or Decimal numeric values in the division. For example, `Double d = 5.0/3.0;` returns 1.6666666666666667 because 5.0 and 3.0 represent Double values, which results in the quotient being a Double as well and no fractional value is lost.
-   **Conversion of Date to Datetime**: Apex supports both implicit and explicit casting of Date values to Datetime, with the time component being zeroed out in the resulting Datetime value.
