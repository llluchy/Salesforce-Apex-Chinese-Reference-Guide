# Access Modifiers

Apex allows you to use the `private`, `protected`, `public`, and `global` access modifiers when defining methods and variables.

While triggers and anonymous blocks can also use these access modifiers, they aren’t as useful in smaller portions of Apex. For example, declaring a method as `global` in an anonymous block doesn’t enable you to call it from outside of that code.

For more information on class access modifiers, see [Apex Class Definition](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_defining.htm).

:::tip Note
Methods defined in an interface have the same access modifier as the interface (`public` or `global`). For more information, see [Interfaces](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_interfaces.htm).
:::

By default, a method or variable is visible only to the Apex code *within the defining class*. Explicitly specify a method or variable as public in order for it to be available to other classes in the same application namespace (see [Namespace Prefix](atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_namespace_prefix.htm "The Salesforce application supports the use of namespace prefixes. Namespace prefixes are used in managed AppExchange packages to differentiate custom object and field names from names used by other organizations.")). You can change the level of visibility by using the following access modifiers:

-   **`private`**: This access modifier is the default, and means that the method or variable is accessible only within the Apex class in which it’s defined. If you don’t specify an access modifier, the method or variable is `private`.
-   **`protected`**: This means that the method or variable is visible to any inner classes in the defining Apex class, and to the classes that extend the defining Apex class. You can only use this access modifier for instance methods and member variables. This setting is strictly more permissive than the default (private) setting, just like Java.
-   **`public`**: This means that the method or variable is accessible by all Apex within a specific package. For accessibility by all second-generation (2GP) managed packages that share a namespace, use `public` with the `@NamespaceAccessible` annotation. Using the public access modifier in no-namespace packages implicitly renders the Apex code as @NamespaceAccessible. 

:::tip Note
In Apex, the `public` access
                  modifier isn’t the same as it is in Java. This was done to discourage joining
                  applications, to keep the code for each application separate. In Apex, if you want
                  to make something public like it is in Java, you must use the `global` access modifier.
:::

 For more information on namespace-based visibility, see [Namespace-Based Visibility for Apex Classes in Second-Generation Packages](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_unlocked_namespace_visibility.htm "HTML (New Window)").
-   **`global`**: This means the method or variable can be used by any Apex code that has access to the class, not just the Apex code in the same application. This access modifier must be used for any method that must be referenced outside of the application, either in SOAP API or by other Apex code. If you declare a method or variable as `global`, you must also declare the class that contains it as `global`.

:::tip Note
We recommend using the `global` access modifier rarely, if at all. Cross-application
                  dependencies are difficult to maintain.
:::

To use the `private`, `protected`, `public`, or `global` access modifiers, use the following syntax:

```apex
[(none)|private|protected|public|global] declaration
```

For example:

```apex
// private variable s1
private string s1 = '1';

// public method getsz()
public string getsz() { 
   ... 
}
```

## Versioned Behavior Changes

In API version 65.0 and later, an abstract or override method requires a `protected`, `public`, or `global` access modifier. If one of these access modifiers isn’t explicitly included in the method declaration, then method access defaults to `private`. Private access is invalid for these method types because the implementing class can’t access the abstract method. Therefore, if you attempt to declare an abstract or override method without an allowed access modifier, you get the compilation error `Abstract methods require at least one of the following: global, public, protected`.
