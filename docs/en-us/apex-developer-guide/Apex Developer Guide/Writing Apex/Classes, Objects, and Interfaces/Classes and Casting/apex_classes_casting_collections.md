# Collection Casting

Because collections in Apex have a declared type at runtime, Apex allows collection casting.

Collections can be cast in a similar manner that arrays can be cast in Java. For example, a list of CustomerPurchaseOrder objects can be assigned to a list of PurchaseOrder objects if class `CustomerPurchaseOrder` is a child of class `PurchaseOrder`.

```apex
public virtual class PurchaseOrder {

    Public class CustomerPurchaseOrder extends PurchaseOrder {

    }
    {
        List POs = new PurchaseOrder[] {};
        List CPOs = new CustomerPurchaseOrder[]{};
        POs = CPOs;
    }
}
```

Once the `CustomerPurchaseOrder` list is assigned to the `PurchaseOrder` list variable, it can be cast back to a list of CustomerPurchaseOrder objects, but only because that instance was originally instantiated as a list of CustomerPurchaseOrder objects. A list of PurchaseOrder objects that is instantiated as such cannot be cast to a list of CustomerPurchaseOrder objects, even if the list of PurchaseOrder objects contains only CustomerPurchaseOrder objects.

If the user of a PurchaseOrder list that only includes CustomerPurchaseOrders objects tries to insert a non-CustomerPurchaseOrder subclass of `PurchaseOrder` (such as `InternalPurchaseOrder`), a runtime exception results. This is because Apex collections have a declared type at runtime.

:::tip Note
Maps behave in the same way as lists with regards to the value side of the Map. If the value
            side of map A can be cast to the value side of map B, and they have the same key type,
            then map A can be cast to map B. A runtime error results if the casting is not valid
            with the particular map at runtime.
