# FunctionInvocationStatus Enum

Represents the status of a Function invocation.

## Enum Values

The following are the values of the `functions.FunctionInvocationStatus` enum.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ERROR` | The invocation failed. Check the FunctionInvocation and FunctionInvocationError returned by the invoke call to debug the issue. |
| `PENDING` | The invocation is pending. If the Function is being invoked asynchronously, the invocation is still in the asynch queue. |
| `SUCCESS` | The invocation succeeded. Use `FunctionInvocation.getResponse()` with the FunctionInvocation instance returned by the invoke call to get any response returned by the Function. |
