# Cache Exceptions

The `Cache` namespace contains exception classes.

All exception classes support built-in methods for returning the error message and exception type. See [Exception Class and Built-In Exceptions](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_classes_exception_methods.htm "An exception denotes an error that disrupts the normal flow of code execution. You can use Apex built-in exceptions or create custom exceptions. All exceptions have common methods.") in the *Apex Developer Guide*.

The `Cache` namespace contains these exceptions.

| Exception | Thrown when |
| --- | --- |
| `Cache.Session.SessionCacheException` | An error occurred while adding or retrieving a value in the session cache. |
| `Cache.Session.SessionCacheNoSessionException` | An attempt is made to access the cache when the session cache isn’t available. |
| `Cache.Org.OrgCacheException` | An attempt is made to access a partition that doesn’t exist or whose name is invalid. |
| `Cache.InvalidParamException` | An invalid parameter value is passed into a method of `Cache.Session` or `Cache.Org`. This error occurs when:
-   The key referenced is null or empty or is not alphanumeric.
-   The key isn’t qualified with the namespace and partition in the format `<namespace>.<partition>.<key>`.
-   The key isn’t qualified in the format `<key>` for the default partition, or for a key inserted through the partition object.
-   The namespace referenced is null or empty.
-   The partition name is null or empty or is not alphanumeric.
-   Another referenced value is null.

 |
| `Cache.ItemSizeLimitExceededException` | A cache `put` call is made with an item that exceeds the maximum size limit. To fix this error, break the item into multiple, smaller items. |
| `Cache.BulkApiKeysLimitExceededException` | The number of key parameters passed into a bulk method - `get(keys)` or `contains(setOfKeys)` exceeds the maximum limit of 10. |
| `Cache.PlatformCacheInvalidOperationException` | A cache `put` or `remove` call is made that is not allowed. For example, when calling `put` or `remove` inside a Visualforce constructor. |
| `Cache.CacheBuilderExecutionException` | This error occurs when the execution of the CacheBuilder fails; this could be due to an error in parsing, a permissions error while accessing records, or an issue with Apex callouts. |
| `Cache.InvalidCacheBuilderException` | A `get(CacheBuilder cb, String key)`, `remove(CacheBuilder cb, String key)`, or `validateCacheBuilder(CacheBuilder cb)` method is called but the `cb` parameter is a class that does not implement the `Cache.CacheBuilder` interface. |
