# GetAppointmentSlotsInput Class

Contains information about the available appointment time slots for a resource based on given work type group and territories.

The appointment time slots are determined based on your Salesforce Scheduler data model configurations. Here are some prerequisites that you can consider while setting up data.

-   Set up Salesforce Scheduler before making your requests. The setup includes creating or configuring Service Resources, Service Territory Members, Work Type Groups, Work Types, Work Type Group Members, and Service Territory Work Types. See [Manage Business Information in Salesforce Scheduler](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.ls_set_up.htm&language=en_US) for more information.
-   Configure a work type mapped for each territory in the request body via Service Territory Work Type. Map the same work type to the work type group, via work type group member.

The following factors affect how time slots are calculated and returned.

-   Timezones that differ across operating hours are handled and results are always returned in UTC.
-   The resource must be marked as a required resource on the assigned resource object.
-   The resource is considered unavailable If the status categories of the resource assigned to service appointments are other than `Canceled`, `Cannot Complete`, and `Completed`.
-   Resource Absences of all types are considered unavailable from start to end.
-   The following fields of Work Type records, if configured, are used to fine-tune time slot requirements. For more information, see [Create Work Types in Salesforce Scheduler](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.ls_create_work_types.htm&language=en_US).
    
    | Parameter | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Timeframe Start | Time slots sooner than `current time + Timeframe Start` aren’t returned. |
    | Timeframe End | Time slots later than `current time + Timeframe End` aren’t returned. |
    | Block Time Before Appointment | The time period before the appointment is considered as unavailable. |
    | Block Time After Appointment | The time period after the appointment is considered as unavailable. |
    | Operating Hours | The overlap of all operating hours from the account, work type, service territory, and service territory member are considered while determining time slots. For more information, see [Set Up Operating Hours in Salesforce Scheduler](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.ls_set_up_oh.htm&type=5&language=en_US). |
    
-   Only the time slots within the period of 31 days from the start date are returned.
-   Salesforce Scheduler uses multiple factors, such as field values, scheduled appointments, absences, Scheduler Settings, and Scheduling Policies to determine available time slots, including the earliest and latest appointment slots. See [How Does Salesforce Scheduler Determine Available Time Slots](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.ls_how_are_time_slots_determined.htm&type=5&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)").

:::tip Note
If asset scheduling is enabled, you can
            provide an asset-based service resource in `requiredResourceIds` to retrieve available timeslots for the asset
            resource.

## Namespace

[LxScheduler](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_namespace_lxscheduler.htm "The LxScheduler namespace provides an interface and classes for integrating Salesforce Scheduler with external calendars.")

## Usage

The constructor for this class can’t be called directly. Create an instance of this class using the [GetAppointmentSlotsInputBuilder.build()](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_lxscheduler_GetAppointmentSlotsInputBuilder.htm#apex_lxscheduler_GetAppointmentSlotsInputBuilder_build "Returns an instance of the lxscheduler.GetAppointmentSlotsInput object.") method.

This example shows how to get a list of available time slots based on `workTypeGroupId`:

```apex
//Build input for GetAppointmentSlots API
   lxscheduler.GetAppointmentSlotsInput input = new lxscheduler.GetAppointmentSlotsInputBuilder()
      .setWorkTypeGroupId('0VSxx0000004C92GAE')
      .setTerritoryIds(new ListString>{'0Hhxx0000004C92CAE'})
      .setStartTime(System.now().format('yyyy-MM-dd\'T\'HH:mm:ssZ'))
      .setEndTime(System.now().addDays(1).format('yyyy-MM-dd\'T\'HH:mm:ssZ'))
      .setAccountId('001xx000003GYK0AAO')
      .setRequiredResourceIds(new ListString>{'0Hnxx0000004C92CAE'})
      .setSchedulingPolicyId('0Vrxx0000004CAe')
      .setApiVersion(Double.valueOf('48.0'))
      .build();

String response = lxscheduler.SchedulerResources.getAppointmentSlots(input);
```

This example shows how to get a list of available time slots based on `workType`:

```apex
//Build WorkType
   lxscheduler.WorkType workType = new lxscheduler.WorkTypeBuilder()
      .setId('08qxx0000004C92AAE')
      .build();

   lxscheduler.GetAppointmentSlotsInput input = new lxscheduler.GetAppointmentSlotsInputBuilder()
      .setWorkType(workType)
      .setTerritoryIds(new ListString>{'0Hhxx0000004C92CAE'})
      .setStartTime(System.now().format('yyyy-MM-dd\'T\'HH:mm:ssZ'))
      .setEndTime(System.now().addDays(1).format('yyyy-MM-dd\'T\'HH:mm:ssZ'))
      .setAccountId('001xx000003GYK0AAO')
      .setRequiredResourceIds(new ListString>{'0Hnxx0000004C92CAE'})
      .setSchedulingPolicyId('0Vrxx0000004CAe')
      .setApiVersion(Double.valueOf('48.0'))
      .build();

String response = lxscheduler.SchedulerResources.getAppointmentSlots(input);
```

This example shows how to get a list of available time slots based on `durationInMinutes` and without `workTypeGroupId` or `workType` fields:

```apex
//Build WorkType
   lxscheduler.WorkType workType = new lxscheduler.WorkTypeBuilder()
      .setDurationInMinutes(60)
      .build();

   lxscheduler.GetAppointmentSlotsInput input = new lxscheduler.GetAppointmentSlotsInputBuilder()
      .setWorkType(workType)
      .setTerritoryIds(new ListString>{'0Hhxx0000004C92CAE'})
      .setRequiredResourceIds(new ListString>{'0Hnxx0000004C92CAE'})
      .setApiVersion(Double.valueOf('48.0'))
      .build();

   String response = lxscheduler.SchedulerResources.getAppointmentSlots(input);
```

This example shows a sample response of a list of available time slots:

```plain
[
   {
     "territoryId": "0Hhxx0000004C92CAE",
     "startTime": "2021-02-10T16:00:00.000+0000",
     "endTime": "2021-02-10T16:15:00.000+0000",
     "remainingAppointments": 1
   },
   {
     "territoryId": "0Hhxx0000004C92CAE",
     "startTime": "2021-02-10T16:15:00.000+0000",
     "endTime": "2021-02-10T16:30:00.000+0000",
     "remainingAppointments": 1
   },
]
```
