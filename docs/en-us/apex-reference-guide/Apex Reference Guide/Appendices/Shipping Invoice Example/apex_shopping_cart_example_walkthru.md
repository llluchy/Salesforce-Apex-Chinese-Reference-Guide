# Shipping Invoice Example Walk-Through

The sample application in this section includes traditional Salesforce functionality blended with Apex. Many of the syntactic and semantic features of Apex, along with common idioms, are illustrated in this application.

:::tip Note
The Shipping Invoice sample requires custom objects. You can either
   create these on your own, or download the objects and Apex code as an unmanaged package from the
   Salesforce AppExchange. To obtain the sample assets in your org, install the [Apex Tutorials Package](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001saDCEAY). This package also
   contains sample code and objects for the [Apex Quick Start](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_qs_HelloWorld.htm).
:::

## Scenario

In this sample application, the user creates a new shipping invoice, or order, and then adds items to the invoice. The total amount for the order, including shipping cost, is automatically calculated and updated based on the items added or deleted from the invoice.

## Data and Code Models

This sample application uses two new objects: Item and Shipping\_invoice.

The following assumptions are made:

-   Item A cannot be in both orders shipping\_invoice1 and shipping\_invoice2. Two customers cannot obtain the same (physical) product.
-   The tax rate is 9.25%.
-   The shipping rate is 75 cents per pound.
-   Once an order is over $100, the shipping discount is applied (shipping becomes free).

The fields in the Item custom object include:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | String | The name of the item |
| Price | Currency | The price of the item |
| Quantity | Number | The number of items in the order |
| Weight | Number | The weight of the item, used to calculate shipping costs |
| Shipping\_invoice | Master-Detail (shipping\_invoice) | The order this item is associated with |

The fields in the Shipping\_invoice custom object include:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | String | The name of the shipping invoice/order |
| Subtotal | Currency | The subtotal |
| GrandTotal | Currency | The total amount, including tax and shipping |
| Shipping | Currency | The amount charged for shipping (assumes $0.75 per pound) |
| ShippingDiscount | Currency | Only applied once when subtotal amount reaches $100 |
| Tax | Currency | The amount of tax (assumes 9.25%) |
| TotalWeight | Number | The total weight of all items |

All of the Apex for this application is contained in triggers. This application has the following triggers:

| Object | Trigger Name | When Runs | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Item | Calculate | after insert, after update, after delete | Updates the shipping invoice, calculates the totals and shipping |
| Shipping\_invoice | ShippingDiscount | after update | Updates the shipping invoice, calculating if there is a shipping discount |

The following is the general flow of user actions and when triggers run:

Flow of user action and triggers for the shopping cart application ![Flow of user action and triggers for shopping cart application](/docs/resources/img/en-us/262.0?doc_id=dev_guides%2Fapex%2Fimages%2Fshopping_cart_app_flow.png&folder=apexref)

1.  User clicks **Orders** | **New**, names the shipping invoice and clicks **Save**.
2.  User clicks **New Item**, fills out information, and clicks **Save**.
3.  Calculate trigger runs. Part of the Calculate trigger updates the shipping invoice.
4.  ShippingDiscount trigger runs.
5.  User can then add, delete or change items in the invoice.

In [Shipping Invoice Example Code](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_shopping_cart_example_code.htm) both of the triggers and the test class are listed. The comments in the code explain the functionality.

## Testing the Shipping Invoice Application

Before an application can be included as part of a package, 75% of the code must be covered by unit tests. Therefore, one piece of the shipping invoice application is a class used for testing the triggers.

The test class verifies the following actions are completed successfully:

-   Inserting items
-   Updating items
-   Deleting items
-   Applying shipping discount
-   Negative test for bad input
