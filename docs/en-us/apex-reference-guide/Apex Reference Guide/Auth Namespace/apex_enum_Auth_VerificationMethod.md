Passwordless login is a convenient, mobile-centric way to welcome users into your site. Let your users log in with something other than their password, like their email address or phone number."), [`System.UserManagement.registerVerificationMethod`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_System_UserManagement.htm#apex_System_UserManagement_registerVerificationMethod "Registers an identity verification method. Verification methods can be a time-based one-time password (TOTP), email or text verification code, Salesforce Authenticator, or U2F-compatible security key.
