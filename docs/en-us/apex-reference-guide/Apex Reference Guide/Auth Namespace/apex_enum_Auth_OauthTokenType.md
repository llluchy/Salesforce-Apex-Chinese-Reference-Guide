| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN` | An opaque access token, which Salesforce grants to a client when it successfully completes an authorization flow. Salesforce grants opaque access tokens by default. |
| `DELETE_TOKEN` | A delete token, which can be queried and used to revoke refresh tokens and associated access tokens. |
