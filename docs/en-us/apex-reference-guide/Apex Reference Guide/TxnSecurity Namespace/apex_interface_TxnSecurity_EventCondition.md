# EventCondition Interface

Allows an implementing class to specify whether to take action when certain events occur based on a transaction security policy. This interface is only used for Apex policies created in Real-Time Event Monitoring.

## Usage

The `evaluate` method is called upon the occurrence of a real-time event monitored by a transaction security policy. A typical implementation first selects the fields of interest from the event. Then the fields are tested to see if they meet the conditions being monitored. If the conditions are met, the method returns `true`.

For example, imagine a transaction security policy that triggers when a user queries more than 1,000 lead records. For each API event, the `evaluate` method checks whether the `RowsProcessed` value is greater than 1,000 and the `QueriedEntities` value contains “Lead”. If so, `true` is returned.

We recommend having test classes for the policy condition interface to ensure it works correctly. Testing is required regardless of whether the policy is moved from a sandbox to production, with a change set, or some other way. For example, test your policies in your development environment before moving the policies to production.

## EventCondition Methods

The EventCondition interface has one method, evaluate(event).

The following are methods for `EventCondition`.

### evaluate(event)

Evaluates an event against a transaction security policy created in Real-Time Event Monitoring. If the event triggers the policy, the method returns `true`.

#### Signature

`public Boolean evaluate(SObject event)`

#### Parameters

-   **var1**:
    
    Type: [SObject](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_sobject.htm#apex_methods_system_sobject "Contains methods for the sObject data type.")
    
    The event to check against the transaction security policy.
    

#### Return Value

Type: [Boolean](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_boolean.htm#apex_methods_system_boolean "Contains methods for the Boolean primitive data type.")

Returns `true` when the policy is triggered. For example, suppose that the policy is to limit users to a single login session. If a user tries to log in a second time, the policy blocks the attempted login, and updates the Status, PolicyId, and PolicyOutcome fields of that LoginEvent. The policy also sends an email notification to the Salesforce admin. The `evaluate` method only checks the login event, and returns `true` if it’s the user’s second login attempt.

The system performs the action and notification, not the `evaluate` method.

## EventCondition Example Implementation

Use EventCondition to create a custom condition for Shield Platform Encryption.

This example shows an implementation of the `TxnSecurity.EventCondition` interface. The transaction security policy triggers when the user queries an Account object.

```apex
public boolean evaluate(ApiEvent event) {
      switch on event {
         when ApiEvent apiEvent {
            return handleApiEvent(apiEvent);
         }
         when null {
         // Trigger action if event is null
            return true;
         }
         when else {
         // Trigger action for unhandled events
            return true;
         }
      }
   }

   private boolean handleApiEvent(ApiEvent apiEvent){
      if(apiEvent.QueriedEntities.contains('Account')){ 
         return true;
      } 
      return false;
   }
}
```
