# DataSource Exceptions

The `DataSource` namespace contains exception classes.

All exception classes support built-in methods for returning the error message and exception type. See [Exception Class and Built-In Exceptions](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_classes_exception_methods.htm "An exception denotes an error that disrupts the normal flow of code execution. You can use Apex built-in exceptions or create custom exceptions. All exceptions have common methods.").

The `DataSource` namespace contains these exceptions.

| Exception | Description | Methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DataSource.​DataSource​Exception` | Throw this exception to indicate that an error occurred while communicating with an external data source. | To get the error message and write it to debug log, use the `String getMessage()`. |
| `DataSource.OAuthTokenExpiredException` | Throw this exception to indicate that an OAuth token has expired. The system then attempts to refresh the token automatically and restart the query, search, or sync operation. | To get the error message and write it to debug log, use the `String getMessage()`. |
