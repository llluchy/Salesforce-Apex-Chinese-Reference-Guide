# DmlOptions.EmailHeader Class

Enables setting email options.

## Namespace

[Database](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_namespace_Database.htm "The Database namespace provides classes used with DML operations.")

## Usage

Even though auto-sent emails can be triggered by actions in the Salesforce user interface, the DMLOptions settings for `emailHeader` take effect only for DML operations carried out in Apex code.

## Example

In the following example, the `triggerAutoResponseEmail` option is specified:

```apex
Account a = new Account(name='Acme Plumbing');
    
    insert a;
    
    Contact c = new Contact(email='jplumber@salesforce.com', firstname='Joe',lastname='Plumber', accountid=a.id);
    
    insert c;
    
    Database.DMLOptions dlo = new Database.DMLOptions();
    
    dlo.EmailHeader.triggerAutoResponseEmail = true;
    
    Case ca = new Case(subject='Plumbing Problems', contactid=c.id);
    
    database.insert(ca, dlo);
```

Suppose that you use an after-insert or after-update trigger to change ownership of leads, contacts, or opportunities. If you use the API to change record ownership, or if a Lightning Experience user changes a record’s owner, no email notification is sent. To send email notifications to a record’s new owner, set the `triggerUserEmail` property to `true`.

### triggerAutoResponseEmail

Indicates whether to trigger auto-response rules (`true`) or not (`false`), for leads and cases.

#### Signature

`public Boolean triggerAutoResponseEmail {get; set;}`

#### Property Value

Type: [Boolean](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_boolean.htm#apex_methods_system_boolean "Contains methods for the Boolean primitive data type.")

#### Usage

This email can be automatically triggered by a number of events, for example creating a case or resetting a user password. If this value is set to `true`, when a case is created, if there is an email address for the contact specified in ContactID, the email is sent to that address. If not, the email is sent to the address specified in SuppliedEmail

### triggerOtherEmail

Indicates whether to trigger email outside the organization (`true`) or not (`false`).

#### Signature

`public Boolean triggerOtherEmail {get; set;}`

#### Property Value

Type: [Boolean](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_boolean.htm#apex_methods_system_boolean "Contains methods for the Boolean primitive data type.")

#### Usage

This email can be automatically triggered by creating, editing, or deleting a contact for a case.

:::tip Note
Email sent through Apex because of a group event includes additional behaviors. A
     group event is an event for which IsGroupEvent is true. The
     `EventAttendee` object tracks the users, leads, or
    contacts that are invited to a group event. Note the following behaviors for group event email
    sent through Apex:
     - Sending a group event invitation to a lead or contact respects the `triggerOtherEmail` option

     - Email sent when updating or deleting a group event also respects the `triggerUserEmail` and `triggerOtherEmail` options, as appropriate
:::

### triggerUserEmail

Indicates whether to trigger email that is sent to users in the organization (`true`) or not (`false`).

#### Signature

`public Boolean triggerUserEmail {get; set;}`

#### Property Value

Type: [Boolean](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_boolean.htm#apex_methods_system_boolean "Contains methods for the Boolean primitive data type.")

#### Usage

This email can be automatically triggered by a number of events; resetting a password, creating a new user, or creating or modifying a task.

:::tip Note
Adding comments to a case in Apex
              doesn’t trigger email to users in the organization even if `triggerUserEmail` is set to `true`.
