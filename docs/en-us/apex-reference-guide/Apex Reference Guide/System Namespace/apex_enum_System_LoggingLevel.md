# LoggingLevel Enum

Specifies the logging level for the `System.debug` method.

## Enum Values

The following are the values of the `System.LoggingLevel` enum, listed from the lowest to the highest levels. The level is cumulative, that is, if you select FINE, the log also includes all events logged at the DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR levels.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NONE` | No logging. |
| `ERROR` | Error and exception logging. |
| `WARN` | Warning logging. |
| `INFO` | Informational logging. |
| `DEBUG` | User-specified debug logging. |
| `FINE` | High level of logging. |
| `FINER` | Higher level of logging than FINE. |
| `FINEST` | Highest level of logging. |

## Usage

Log levels are cumulative. For example, if the lowest level, `ERROR`, is specified for Apex code, only `System.debug` methods with the log level of `ERROR` are logged. If the next log level, `WARN`, is specified, `System.debug` methods specified with either `ERROR` or `WARN` levels are logged.

In this example, if the log level is set to `ERROR`, the string `MsgTxt` isn’t written to the debug log because the `debug` method has a level of `INFO`.

```apex
System.debug(logginglevel.INFO, 'MsgTxt');
```
