# Answers Class

Represents zone answers.

## Namespace

[System](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_namespace_System.htm "The System namespace provides classes and methods for core Apex functionality.")

## Usage

Answers is a feature that enables users to ask questions and have zone members post replies. Members can then vote on the helpfulness of each reply, and the person who asked the question can mark one reply as the best answer.

For more information on answers, see “Answers Overview” in the Salesforce online help.

## Example

The following example finds questions in an internal zone that have similar titles as a new question:

```apex
public class FindSimilarQuestionController {

   public static void test() {
   // Instantiate a new question 
   Question question = new Question ();

   // Specify a title for the new question
   question.title = 'How much vacation time do full-time employees get?';

   // Specify the communityID (INTERNAL_COMMUNITY) in which to find similar questions. 
   Community community = [ SELECT Id FROM Community WHERE Name = 'INTERNAL_COMMUNITY' ];

   question.communityId = community.id;

   ID[] results = Answers.findSimilar(question);
   }
}
```

The following example marks a reply as the best reply:

```apex
ID questionId = [SELECT Id FROM Question WHERE Title = 'Testing setBestReplyId' LIMIT 1].Id;
ID replyID = [SELECT Id FROM Reply WHERE QuestionId = :questionId LIMIT 1].Id;
Answers.setBestReply(questionId,replyId);
```

#### Usage

Each `findSimilar` call counts against the SOSL statements governor limit allowed for the process.
