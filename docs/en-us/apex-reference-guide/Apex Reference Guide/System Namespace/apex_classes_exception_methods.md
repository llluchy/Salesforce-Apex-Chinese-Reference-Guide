# Exception Class and Built-In Exceptions

An exception denotes an error that disrupts the normal flow of code execution. You can use Apex built-in exceptions or create custom exceptions. All exceptions have common methods.

All exceptions support built-in methods for returning the error message and exception type. In addition to the standard `exception` class, there are several different types of exceptions:

The following are exceptions in the `System` namespace.

| Exception | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AssertException` | A System.assert failure that halts code execution. Optionally contains the custom message specified in the last (`msg`) argument to the `assert()` method. |
| `AuraException` | Legacy Aura-related exception. Use System.AuraHandledException instead. |
| `AuraHandledException` | Returns a custom error message to a JavaScript controller. See [Returning Errors from an Apex Server-Side Controller](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.lightning.meta/lightning/controllers_server_apex_custom_errors.htm "HTML (New Window)"). |
| `AsyncException` | Any problem with an asynchronous operation, such as failing to enqueue an asynchronous call. |
| `BigObjectException` | Any problem with big object records, such as connection timeouts during attempts to access or insert big object records. |
| `CalloutException` | Any problem with a web service operation, such as failing to make a callout to an external system. |
| `DataWeaveScriptException` | Any run-time script errors that occur within DataWeave in Apex. |
| `DmlException` | Any problem with a DML statement, such as an `insert` statement missing a required field on a record. |
| `DuplicateMessageException` | Attempt to enqueue job with duplicate queueable signature |
| `EmailException` | Any problem with email, such as failure to deliver. For more information, see [Outbound Email](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_forcecom_email_outbound.htm). |
| `ExternalObjectException` | Any problem with external object records, such as connection timeouts during attempts to access the data that’s stored on external systems. |
| `FatalCursorException` | Any problem with Apex cursors in a transaction. |
| `FinalException` | Any attempt to mutate a read-only collection or record such as an sObject in an after-update trigger, or a final variable. This exception causes execution to halt. |
| `FlowException` | Any problem with starting flow interviews from Apex. For example, if an active version of the flow can’t be found or it can’t be started from Apex. |
| `HandledException` | A generic handled exception. |
| `IllegalArgumentException` | An illegal argument was provided to a method call. For example, a method that requires a non-null argument throws this exception if a null value is passed into the method. |
| `InvalidHeaderException` | An illegal header argument was provided to an Apex REST call. For example, a call to the `RestResponse.addHeader(name, value)` method throws this exception if the header name is `cookie`. |
| `InvalidParameterValueException` | This exception is used with both Visualforce pages and Salesforce Functions.
-   **Visualforce**: The exception is thrown when an invalid parameter is supplied for a method, or any problem is encountered with a URL used with Visualforce pages. For more information on Visualforce, see the [Visualforce Developer's Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.pages.meta/pages/ "Adobe Acrobat PDF (New Window)").

## Common Exception Method

Exception methods are all called by and operate on an instance of an exception. This table describes all instance exception methods. All types of exceptions have these methods in common.

| Name | Arguments | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `getCause` |  | Exception | Returns the cause of the exception as an exception object. |
| `getLineNumber` |  | Integer | Returns the line number from where the exception was thrown. |
| `getMessage` |  | String | Returns the error message that displays for the user. |
| `getStackTraceString` |  | String | Returns the stack trace of a thrown exception as a string. |
| `getTypeName` |  | String | Returns the type of exception, such as DmlException, ListException, MathException, and so on. |
| `initCause` | Exception cause | Void | Sets the cause for this exception, if one hasn’t already been set. |
| `setMessage` | String s | Void | Sets the error message that displays for the user. |

## DMLException and EmailException Methods

In addition to the common exception methods, DMLException and EmailException have these methods:

| Name | Arguments | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `getDmlFieldNames` | Integer i | String \[\] | Returns the names of the field or fields that caused the error described by the ith failed row. |
| `getDmlFields` | Integer i | Schema.sObjectField \[\] | Returns the field token or tokens for the field or fields that caused the error described by the ith failed row. For more information on field tokens, see [Dynamic Apex](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dynamic.htm). |
| `getDmlId` | Integer i | String | Returns the ID of the failed record that caused the error described by the ith failed row. |
| `getDmlIndex` | Integer i | Integer | Returns the original row position of the ith failed row. |
| `getDmlMessage` | Integer i | String | Returns the user message for the ith failed row. |
| `getDmlStatusCode` | Integer i | String | Deprecated. Use getDmlType instead. Returns the Apex failure code for the ith failed row. |
| `getDmlType` | Integer i | [System.StatusCode](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/langCon_apex_enums.htm) | Returns the value of the System.StatusCode enum. For an example, see [getDmlType Example](#ex_dml_type).
For more information about System.StatusCode, see [Enums](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/langCon_apex_enums.htm).

 |
| `getNumDml` |  | Integer | Returns the number of failed rows for DML exceptions. |

## QueryException Method

In addition to the common exception methods, QueryException has this method.

| Name | Arguments | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `getInaccessibleFields` |  | [Map](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_map.htm#apex_methods_system_map "Contains methods for the Map collection type.")<[String](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_string.htm#apex_methods_system_string "Contains methods for the String primitive data type."),[Set<](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_set.htm#apex_methods_system_set "Represents a collection of unique elements with no duplicate values.")[String](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_string.htm#apex_methods_system_string "Contains methods for the String primitive data type.")\>> | Returns a map in which each key is an `sObjectType` and its corresponding value is the set of inaccessible field names in fully qualified format (Namespace\_\_FieldName\_\_c).
Use this method to determine the cause of the `QueryException`. The returned map contains data only if the method that threw the `QueryException` is running in user mode.

For an example, see [getInaccessibleFields Example](#ex_inaccessible_fields).

## NullPointerException Example

```apex
String s;
s.toLowerCase(); // Since s is null, this call causes
                 // a NullPointerException
```

## getDmlType Example

```apex
try {
  insert as user new Account();
}   catch (System.DmlException ex) {
      Assert.areEqual(
         StatusCode.REQUIRED_FIELD_MISSING,
         ex.getDmlType(0));
}
```

## getInaccessibleFields Example

In this code sample, it's assumed that the user doesn't have field level security access to the `Contact.Email` and `Account.Website` fields.

```apex
try {
    List accounts = [SELECT Website, (SELECT Email FROM Contacts) FROM Account WITH USER_MODE];
} catch (QueryException qe) {
    // Handle inaccessible fields
    MapString, SetString>> inaccessible = qe.getInaccessibleFields();
    SetString> accountFields = inaccessible.get('Account');
    SetString> contactFields = inaccessible.get('Contact');
}
```
