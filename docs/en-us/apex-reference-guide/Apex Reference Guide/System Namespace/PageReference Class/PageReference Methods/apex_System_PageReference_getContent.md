# getContent()

Returns the output of the page, as displayed to a user in a web browser.

## Signature

`public Blob getContent()`

## Return Value

Type: [Blob](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_blob.htm#apex_methods_system_blob "Contains methods for the Blob primitive data type.")

## Usage

The content of the returned Blob depends on how the page is rendered. If the page is rendered as a PDF file, it returns the PDF document. If the page isn’t rendered as PDF, it returns HTML. To access the content of the returned HTML as a string, use the `toString` Blob method. If the Visualforce page has an error, an `ExecutionException` is thrown.

You can’t use the `getContent` method in:

-   Triggers
-   Test methods. If you use `getContent` in a test method, the test method fails. `getContent` is treated as a callout in API version 34.0 and later.
-   Apex email services

You also can’t use the method to retrieve the output of a different Visualforce page with the same controller and controller extensions. Instead, pass the base URL of the destination page.

```apex
new PageReference(Site.getBaseUrl() + '/apex/VisualforcePageName').getContent();
```
