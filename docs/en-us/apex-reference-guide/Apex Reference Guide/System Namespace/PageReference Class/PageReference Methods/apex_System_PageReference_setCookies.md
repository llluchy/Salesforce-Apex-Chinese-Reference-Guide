# setCookies(cookies)

Creates a list of cookie objects. Used in conjunction with the `Cookie` class.

## Signature

`public Void setCookies(Cookie[] cookies)`

## Parameters

-   **cookies**: Type: [System.Cookie](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_classes_sites_cookie.htm#apex_classes_sites_cookie "The Cookie class lets you access cookies for your Salesforce site using Apex.")\[\]

## Return Value

Type: Void

## Usage

:::tip Important
- Cookie names and values set in Apex are URL encoded, that is, characters such as @ are
      replaced with a percent sign and their hexadecimal representation. 

     - The `setCookies` method adds the prefix
       “apex__” to the cookie names. 

     - Setting a cookie's value to `null` sends a cookie
      with an empty string value instead of setting an expired attribute.

     - After you create a cookie, the properties of the cookie can't be changed.

     - Be careful when storing sensitive information in cookies. Pages are cached regardless of a
      cookie value. If you use a cookie value to generate dynamic content, you should disable page
      caching. For more information, see [Configure Site Caching](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=platform.sites_caching.htm&type=5&language=en_US) in Salesforce Help.
