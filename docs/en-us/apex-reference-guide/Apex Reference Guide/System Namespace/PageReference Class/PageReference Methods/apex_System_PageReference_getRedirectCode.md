-   301 — Moved Permanently. Redirect users by sending an HTTP GET request to the target location. Includes instructions to update any references to the requested URL with the target location.
-   302 — Moved Temporarily. Redirect users by sending an HTTP GET request to the target location. Because the redirection is temporary, it doesn’t include update instructions.
-   303 — See Other. Redirect users by sending an HTTP GET request to the target location. Not commonly used. Useful when the client sends a POST request and you want the client to call the new web page using a GET request instead of a POST request.
-   307 — Temporary Redirect. Send the same HTTP request, regardless of the HTTP method, to the target location. Because the redirection is temporary, it doesn’t include update instructions.
-   308 — Permanent Redirect. Send the same HTTP request, regardless of the HTTP method, to the target location. Includes instructions to update any references to the requested URL with the target location.
