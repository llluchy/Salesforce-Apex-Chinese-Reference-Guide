### getOperationId(result)

Returns the event UUID, which identifies a published event message.

#### Signature

`public static String getOperationId(Object result)`

#### Parameters

-   **result**: Type: Object The SaveResult that is returned by the `EventBus.publish` call.

#### Return Value

Type: [String](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_string.htm#apex_methods_system_string "Contains methods for the String primitive data type.")

#### Usage

-   If the event publish request fails to be enqueued in Salesforce, and `EventBus.publish` returns a synchronous error, `getOperationId` returns null. Also in this case, `getOperationId` returns null even when the event was created using the [newSObject(recordTypeId, loadDefaults)](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_Schema_SObjectType.htm#apex_Schema_SObjectType_newSObject_3 "Constructs a new sObject of this type, and optionally, of the specified record type ID and with default custom field values.") method and contains a prepopulated UUID.

### publish(event)

Publishes the given platform event.

#### Signature

`public static Database.SaveResult publish(SObject event)`

#### Parameters

-   **event**: Type: [SObject](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_sobject.htm#apex_methods_system_sobject "Contains methods for the sObject data type.") An instance of a platform event. For example, an instance of MyEvent\_\_e. You must first define your platform event object in your org.

#### Return Value

Type: [Database.SaveResult](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_database_saveresult.htm#apex_methods_system_database_saveresult "The result of an insert or update DML operation returned by a Database method.")

The result of publishing the given event. `Database.SaveResult` contains information about whether the operation was successful and the errors encountered. If the `isSuccess()` method returns `true`, the publish request is queued in Salesforce and the event message is published asynchronously. For more information, see [High-Volume Platform Event Persistence](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_considerations.htm#pe_async_publish_errors). If `isSuccess()` returns `false`, the event publish operation resulted in errors, which are returned in the `Database.Error` object. This method doesn’t throw an exception due to an unsuccessful publish operation.

`Database.SaveResult` also contains the `Id` system field. The `Id` field value isn’t included in the event message delivered to subscribers. It isn’t used to identify an event message, and isn’t always unique.

This method returns a `System.UnexpectedException` if you attempt to publish an `SObject` that represents an object that isn’t a platform event.

#### Usage

-   The platform event message is published either immediately or after a transaction is committed, depending on the publish behavior you set in the platform event definition. For more information, see [Platform Event Fields](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_define_ui.htm) in the *[Platform Events Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_intro.htm)*.
-   Apex governor limits apply. For events configured with the **Publish After Commit** behavior, each method execution is counted as one DML statement against the Apex DML statement limit. You can check limit usage using the [`Limits.getDMLStatements()`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_limits.htm#apex_System_Limits_getDMLStatements "Returns the number of DML statements (such as insert, update or the database.EmptyRecycleBin method) that have been called.") method. For events configured with the **Publish Immediately** behavior, each method execution is counted against a separate event publishing limit of 150 `EventBus.publish()` calls. You can check limit usage using the [`Limits.getPublishImmediateDML()`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_limits.htm#apex_System_limits_getPublishImmediateDML "Returns the number of EventBus.publish calls that have been made for platform events configured to publish immediately.") method.
-   Prior to API version 67.0, this method ran with `AccessLevel.SYSTEM_MODE` access. Starting with API version 67.0, it runs with `AccessLevel.USER_MODE` access. The user will be the automated process user unless you set a user using the PlatformEventSubscriberConfig.

### publish(events)

Publishes the given list of platform events.

#### Signature

`public static List<Database.SaveResult> publish(List<SObject> events)`

#### Parameters

-   **events**: Type: List<[sObject](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_sobject.htm#apex_methods_system_sobject "Contains methods for the sObject data type.")\> A list of platform event instances. For example, a list of MyEvent\_\_e objects. You must first define your platform event object in your Salesforce org.

#### Return Value

Type: List<[Database.SaveResult](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_database_saveresult.htm#apex_methods_system_database_saveresult "The result of an insert or update DML operation returned by a Database method.")\>

A list of results, each corresponding to the result of publishing one event. For each event, `Database.SaveResult` contains information about whether the operation was successful and the errors encountered. If the `isSuccess()` method returns `true`, the publish request is queued in Salesforce and the event message is published asynchronously. For more information, see [High-Volume Platform Event Persistence](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_considerations.htm#pe_async_publish_errors "HTML (New Window)"). If `isSuccess()` returns `false`, the event publish operation resulted in errors, which are returned in the `Database.Error` object. `EventBus.publish()` can publish some passed-in events, even when other events can’t be published due to errors. The `EventBus.publish()` method doesn’t throw exceptions caused by an unsuccessful publish operation. It’s similar in behavior to the Apex `Database.insert` method when called with the partial success option.

`Database.SaveResult` also contains the `Id` system field. The `Id` field value isn’t included in the event message delivered to subscribers. It isn’t used to identify an event message, and isn’t always unique.

If an empty list is passed in for the events parameter, no event is published, and an empty `List<Database.SaveResult>` is returned.

This method returns a `System.UnexpectedException` if you attempt to publish a list of type `List<SObject>` that contains objects that aren’t platform events.

#### Usage

-   The platform event message is published either immediately or after a transaction is committed, depending on the publish behavior you set in the platform event definition. For more information, see [Platform Event Fields](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_define_ui.htm) in the *[Platform Events Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_intro.htm)*.
-   Apex governor limits apply. For events configured with the **Publish After Commit** behavior, each method execution is counted as one DML statement against the Apex DML statement limit. You can check limit usage using the [`Limits.getDMLStatements()`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_limits.htm#apex_System_Limits_getDMLStatements "Returns the number of DML statements (such as insert, update or the database.EmptyRecycleBin method) that have been called.") method. For events configured with the **Publish Immediately** behavior, each method execution is counted against a separate event publishing limit of 150 `EventBus.publish()` calls. You can check limit usage using the [`Limits.getPublishImmediateDML()`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_limits.htm#apex_System_limits_getPublishImmediateDML "Returns the number of EventBus.publish calls that have been made for platform events configured to publish immediately.") method.
-   Prior to API version 67.0, this method ran with `AccessLevel.SYSTEM_MODE` access. Starting with API version 67.0, it runs with `AccessLevel.USER_MODE` access. The user will be the automated process user unless you set a user using the PlatformEventSubscriberConfig.

-   The platform event message is published either immediately or after a transaction is committed, depending on the publish behavior you set in the platform event definition. For more information, see [Platform Event Fields](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_define_ui.htm) in the [Platform Events Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_intro.htm).
-   Apex governor limits apply. For events configured with the **Publish After Commit** behavior, each method execution is counted as one DML statement against the Apex DML statement limit. You can check limit usage using the [`Limits.getDMLStatements()`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_limits.htm#apex_System_Limits_getDMLStatements "Returns the number of DML statements (such as insert, update or the database.EmptyRecycleBin method) that have been called.") method. For events configured with the **Publish Immediately** behavior, each method execution is counted against a separate event publishing limit of 150 `EventBus.publish()` calls. You can check limit usage using the [`Limits.getPublishImmediateDML()`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_limits.htm#apex_System_limits_getPublishImmediateDML "Returns the number of EventBus.publish calls that have been made for platform events configured to publish immediately.") method.

### publishWithAccessLevel(events, callback, accesslevel)

Publishes the given list of platform events using the specified callback. To track asynchronous publish failures, you can implement an Apex publish callback.

#### Signature

`public static List<Database.SaveResult> publishWithAccessLevel(List<SObject> sobjects, Object callback, AccessLevel accesslevel)`

#### Parameters

-   **sobjects**: Type: List<[SObject](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_sobject.htm#apex_methods_system_sobject "Contains methods for the sObject data type.")\> A list of platform event instances. For example, a list of MyEvent\_\_e objects. You must first define your platform event object in your Salesforce org.
-   **callback**: Type: Object An Apex class that implements the [EventPublishFailureCallback Interface](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_interface_eventbus_EventPublishFailureCallback.htm#apex_interface_eventbus_EventPublishFailureCallback "Implement this interface to track platform event messages that failed to publish. The onFailure() method in this interface is called when the final result of the asynchronous publish operation becomes available.") or [EventPublishSuccessCallback Interface](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_interface_eventbus_EventPublishSuccessCallback.htm#apex_interface_eventbus_EventPublishSuccessCallback "Implement this interface to track platform event messages that were published successfully. The onSuccess() method in this interface is called when the final result of the asynchronous publish operation becomes available.").
-   **accesslevel**: Type: [AccessLevel](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_System_AccessLevel.htm#apex_class_System_AccessLevel "Defines the different modes, such as system or user mode, that Apex database operations execute in.") Either `AccessLevel.SYSTEM_MODE` or `AccessLevel.USER_MODE`. Can't be null. The user is the automated process user unless a user is set using the PlatformEventSubscriberConfig.

#### Return Value

Type: List<[Database.SaveResult](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_database_saveresult.htm#apex_methods_system_database_saveresult "The result of an insert or update DML operation returned by a Database method.")\>

A list of results, each corresponding to the result of publishing one event. For each event, `Database.SaveResult` contains information about whether the operation was successful and the errors encountered. If the `isSuccess()` method returns `true`, the publish request is queued in Salesforce and the event message is published asynchronously. For more information, see [High-Volume Platform Event Persistence](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_considerations.htm#pe_async_publish_errors "HTML (New Window)"). If `isSuccess()` returns `false`, the event publish operation resulted in errors, which are returned in the `Database.Error` object. `EventBus.publish()` can publish some passed-in events, even when other events can’t be published due to errors. The `EventBus.publish()` method doesn’t throw exceptions caused by an unsuccessful publish operation. It’s similar in behavior to the Apex `Database.insert` method when called with the partial success option.

If an empty list is passed in for the events parameter, no event is published, and an empty `List<Database.SaveResult>` is returned.

This method returns a `System.UnexpectedException` if you attempt to publish a list of type `List<SObject>` that contains objects that aren’t platform events.

#### Usage

-   Use this method with Apex publish callbacks.
