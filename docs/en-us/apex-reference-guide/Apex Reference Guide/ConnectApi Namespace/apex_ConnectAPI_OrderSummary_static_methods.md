### adjustPreview(orderSummaryId, adjustInput)

Retrieve the expected results of adjusting the price of one or more OrderItemSummaries from an OrderSummary, without actually executing the adjustment. The response data contains the financial changes that would result from submitting the proposed adjustment.

#### API Version

49.0

#### Requires Chatter

No

#### Signature

`public static ConnectApi.AdjustOrderSummaryOutputRepresentation adjustPreview(String orderSummaryId, ConnectApi.AdjustOrderItemSummaryInputRepresentation adjustInput)`

#### Parameters

orderSummaryId

Type: String

ID of the OrderSummary.

adjustInput

Type: `ConnectApi.AdjustOrderItemSummaryInputRepresentation`

Price adjustments to order item summaries that together make up a price adjustment to an order, with options for adjusting items in the process of being fulfilled.

#### Return Value

Type: `ConnectApi.AdjustOrderSummaryOutputRepresentation`

#### Usage

When a price adjustment is applied to an OrderItemSummary, its quantities are considered in three groups:

Pre-fulfillment

QuantityAvailableToFulfill, which is equal to QuantityOrdered - QuantityCanceled - QuantityAllocated

In-fulfillment

QuantityAllocated - QuantityFulfilled

Post-fulfillment

QuantityAvailableToReturn, which is equal to QuantityFulfilled - QuantityReturnInitiated

You can apply adjustments to these groups in three different ways, controlled by the allocatedItemsChangeOrderType input property:

-   Distribute the adjustment evenly between pre-fulfillment and post-fulfillment quantities. Ignore in-fulfillment quantities. Submitting the adjustment would create one change order for the adjustments to pre-fulfillment quantities and one change order for the adjustments to post-fulfillment quantities.
-   Distribute the adjustment evenly between pre-fulfillment, in-fulfillment, and post-fulfillment quantities. Submitting the adjustment would create one change order for the adjustments to both pre-fulfillment and in-fulfillment quantities, and one change order for the adjustments to post-fulfillment quantities.
-   Distribute the adjustment evenly between pre-fulfillment, in-fulfillment, and post-fulfillment quantities. Submitting the adjustment would create one change order for the adjustments to pre-fulfillment quantities, one change order for the adjustments to in-fulfillment quantities, and one change order for the adjustments to post-fulfillment quantities.

### adjustSubmit(orderSummaryId, adjustInput)

Adjust the price of one or more OrderItemSummaries from an OrderSummary, and create corresponding change orders.

#### API Version

49.0

#### Requires Chatter

No

#### Signature

`public static ConnectApi.AdjustOrderSummaryOutputRepresentation adjustSubmit(String orderSummaryId, ConnectApi.AdjustOrderItemSummaryInputRepresentation adjustInput)`

#### Parameters

orderSummaryId

Type: String

ID of the OrderSummary.

adjustInput

Type: `ConnectApi.AdjustOrderItemSummaryInputRepresentation`

Price adjustments to order item summaries that together make up a price adjustment to an order, with options for adjusting items in the process of being fulfilled.

#### Return Value

Type: `ConnectApi.AdjustOrderSummaryOutputRepresentation`

#### Usage

When a price adjustment is applied to an OrderItemSummary, its quantities are considered in three groups:

Pre-fulfillment

QuantityAvailableToFulfill, which is equal to QuantityOrdered - QuantityCanceled - QuantityAllocated

In-fulfillment

QuantityAllocated - QuantityFulfilled

Post-fulfillment

QuantityAvailableToReturn, which is equal to QuantityFulfilled - QuantityReturnInitiated

You can apply adjustments to these groups in three different ways, controlled by the allocatedItemsChangeOrderType input property:

-   Distribute the adjustment evenly between pre-fulfillment and post-fulfillment quantities. Ignore in-fulfillment quantities. Create one change order for the adjustments to pre-fulfillment quantities and one change order for the adjustments to post-fulfillment quantities.
-   Distribute the adjustment evenly between pre-fulfillment, in-fulfillment, and post-fulfillment quantities. Create one change order for the adjustments to both pre-fulfillment and in-fulfillment quantities, and one change order for the adjustments to post-fulfillment quantities.
-   Distribute the adjustment evenly between pre-fulfillment, in-fulfillment, and post-fulfillment quantities. Create one change order for the adjustments to pre-fulfillment quantities, one change order for the adjustments to in-fulfillment quantities, and one change order for the adjustments to post-fulfillment quantities.

After submitting a price adjustment, process refunds as appropriate:

-   If the discount only applied to OrderItemSummaries for which payment hasn’t been captured, it doesn’t require a refund. This situation normally applies to OrderItemSummaries in the US that haven’t been fulfilled.
-   If the discount applied to OrderItemSummaries that haven’t been fulfilled and for which payment has been captured, process a refund. In this case, pass the totalExcessFundsAmount from the output representation to the [`ensureRefundsAsync()`](#apex_ConnectAPI_OrderSummary_ensureRefundsAsync_1 "Ensure refunds for a CreditMemo or excess funds by sending a request to a payment provider. This method inserts a background operation into an asynchronous job queue and returns the ID of that operation so you can track its status.

If a processed ReturnOrderLineItem has any remaining expected quantity, then the API creates a separate ReturnOrderLineItem representing that quantity.")
    

### ensureFundsAsync(orderSummaryId, ensureFundsInput)

Ensure funds for an Invoice and apply them to it and optional define a sequence to capture payments in. If needed, capture authorized funds by sending a request to a payment provider. This method inserts a background operation into an asynchronous job queue and returns the ID of that operation so you can track its status. Payment gateway responses appear in the payment gateway log and do not affect the background operation status.

#### API Version

48.0

#### Requires Chatter

No

#### Signature

`public static ConnectApi.EnsureFundsAsyncOutputRepresentation ensureFundsAsync(String orderSummaryId, ConnectApi.EnsureFundsAsyncInputRepresentation ensureFundsInput)`

#### Parameters

isConsiderReservedBalanceAmount

Type: Boolean

If true, the reserved balance amount is used for the Order Summary to fund the invoice. If not enough reserved balance amount, any available balance that isn’t reserved by another Order Summary is used. If false, any available balance is used.

orderSummaryId

Type: String

ID of the OrderSummary.

ensureFundsInput

Type: `ConnectApi.EnsureFundsAsyncInputRepresentation`

The ID of the Invoice. If multiple payments are allowed, you can also specify a sequence to capture payments for the invoice.

#### Return Value

Type: `ConnectApi.EnsureFundsAsyncOutputRepresentation`

#### Usage

This method checks the OrderPaymentSummaries associated with the specified OrderSummary for funds to apply to the Invoice balance following this logic:

:::tip Note
If multiple OrderPaymentSummaries have equal
          BalanceAmount values, their order of selection is random.
:::

1.  Verify that the Invoice balance doesn’t exceed the total BalanceAmount of all the OrderPaymentSummaries associated with the OrderSummary.
2.  If an OrderPaymentSummary has a BalanceAmount equal to the Invoice balance, apply the funds from that OrderPaymentSummary.
3.  If no exact match was found, apply funds from the OrderPaymentSummary with the largest BalanceAmount.
4.  If the Invoice still has a balance to ensure, repeat steps 2 and 3 until the full balance is ensured or no captured funds remain.
5.  If the Invoice still has a balance, look for an OrderPaymentSummary with an authorized amount equal to the remaining Invoice balance. If one exists, capture and apply the funds from that OrderPaymentSummary.
6.  If no exact match was found, capture and apply funds from the OrderPaymentSummary with the largest authorized amount.
7.  If the Invoice still has a balance to ensure, repeat steps 5 and 6 until the full balance is ensured.

:::tip Note
If the method creates a payment, the payment record’s
        ClientContext value isn’t predictable. Don't use it in custom logic.

### ensureRefundsAsync(orderSummaryId, ensureRefundsInput)

Ensure refunds for a CreditMemo or excess funds by sending a request to a payment provider. This method inserts a background operation into an asynchronous job queue and returns the ID of that operation so you can track its status. Payment gateway responses appear in the payment gateway log and don’t affect the background operation status.

#### API Version

48.0

#### Requires Chatter

No

#### Signature

`public static ConnectApi.EnsureRefundsAsyncOutputRepresentation ensureRefundsAsync(String orderSummaryId, ConnectApi.EnsureRefundsAsyncInputRepresentation ensureRefundsInput)`

#### Parameters

isConsiderReservedBalanceAmount

Type: Boolean

If true, the refundable amount is used to open the payment balance for the reservedBalanceAmount in the Order Payment Summaries. The remaining refundable amount considers the sequence of order payment summaries, if provided. If false, any reserved balance amount for exchanges is refunded.

orderSummaryId

Type: String

ID of the OrderSummary.

ensureRefundsInput

Type: `ConnectApi.EnsureRefundsAsyncInputRepresentation`

ID of a credit memo to ensure refunds for, an amount of excess funds to refund, or both. At least one is required. Also includes any invoices for fees that reduce the refund amount, such as return fees. If multiple payment methods are available, you can specify how to distribute the refund.

#### Return Value

Type: `ConnectApi.EnsureRefundsAsyncOutputRepresentation`

#### Usage

This method applies the refund to the OrderPaymentSummaries associated with the specified OrderSummary following this logic.

:::tip Note
If multiple OrderPaymentSummaries have equal
          AvailableToRefund amounts, their order of selection is random.
:::

1.  Verify that the CreditMemo balance and excess funds amount don't exceed the total AvailableToRefund amount of all the OrderPaymentSummaries associated with the OrderSummary.
2.  If sequences is specified, follow these steps.
    1.  Traverse the sequences list in order and apply the specified refund amounts to the specified OrderPaymentSummaries.
    2.  If the specified CreditMemo and excess funds are fully refunded, or if isAllowPartial is true, then the action stops here.
3.  If a CreditMemo is specified, follow these steps.
    1.  If an OrderPaymentSummary has an AvailableToRefund amount matching the CreditMemo’s remaining balance, apply the refund to that payment.
    2.  If no exact match was found but one or more OrderPaymentSummary has a large enough AvailableToRefund amount to cover the balance, use the OrderPaymentSummary with the smallest AvailableToRefund amount.
    3.  If no single OrderPaymentSummary has a large enough AvailableToRefund amount, use multiple OrderPaymentSummaries in descending order of AvailableToRefund amount. This ensures the fewest OrderPaymentSummaries are used.
4.  If only one OrderPaymentSummary is specified but has multiple payments, follow these steps.
    1.  If a payment has an amount matching the CreditMemo’s remaining balance, apply the refund to that payment.
    2.  If no exact match was found but one or more payment has a large enough amount to cover the balance, use the payment with the smallest amount.
    3.  If no single payment has a large enough amount, use multiple payments in descending order of amount. This ensures the fewest payments are used.
5.  If an excess funds amount is specified, follow these steps.
    1.  Examine those OrderPaymentSummaries. If one has an AvailableToRefund amount matching the excess funds amount, apply the refund to that OrderPaymentSummary.
    2.  If no exact match was found but one or more OrderPaymentSummary has a large enough AvailableToRefund amount to cover the balance, use the OrderPaymentSummary with the smallest AvailableToRefund amount.
    3.  If no single OrderPaymentSummary has a large enough AvailableToRefund amount, use multiple OrderPaymentSummaries in descending order of AvailableToRefund amount. This ensures the fewest OrderPaymentSummaries are used.

:::tip Note
If the method creates a refund, the refund record’s ClientContext
        value isn’t predictable. Don't use it in custom logic.
