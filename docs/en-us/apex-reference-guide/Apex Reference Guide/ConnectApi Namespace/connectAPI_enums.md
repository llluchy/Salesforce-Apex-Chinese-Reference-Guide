# ConnectApi Enums

Enums specific to the `ConnectApi` namespace.

`ConnectApi` enums inherit all properties and methods of Apex enums.

Enums are not versioned. Enum values are returned in all API versions. Clients must handle values they don't understand gracefully.

| Enum | Description |

| `ConnectApi.​ActionLink​ExecutionsAllowed` | Number of times an action link can be executed.
