This unit of time is combined with a number (specified by the `pricingTerm` property) to define the full term of the subscription. For example, if the unit of time is `Months` and the `pricingTerm` property is set to 1, the subscription is priced monthly. However, if the `sellingModelType` property is set to `OneTime`, the `pricingTermUnit` property is empty, because the product isn’t sold as a subscription.
