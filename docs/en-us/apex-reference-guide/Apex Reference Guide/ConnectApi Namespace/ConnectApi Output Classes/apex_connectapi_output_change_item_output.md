# ConnectApi.ChangeItemOutputRepresentation

The financial changes resulting from a change to one or more OrderItemSummaries. Most of the values represent the deltas of the values on the associated OrderSummary. The sign of each value is the opposite of the corresponding value on a change order record. For example, a discount is a positive value here and a negative value on a change order record.

| `totalRefundable​Amount` | Double | Total amount available to be refunded. It is the sum of the excess funds and any outstanding change order grand total amounts that apply to post-fulfillment changes. This value includes all current refundable amounts related to the OrderSummary, not only the amount related to the current change. | 48.0 |
| `totalRequired​FundsAmount` | Double | The required funds associated with added order items. | 54.0 |
