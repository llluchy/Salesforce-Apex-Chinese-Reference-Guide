# ConnectApi.ContentCapability

If a comment has this capability, it has a file attachment.

Subclass of [ConnectApi.FeedElementCapability](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_connectapi_output_feed_element_capability.htm "A feed element capability, which defines the characteristics of a feed element.").

For files attached to a feed post (instead of a comment) in version 36.0 and later, use `ConnectApi.FilesCapability`.

If content is deleted from a feed element after it’s posted or if the access to the content is changed to private, the `ConnectApi.ContentCapability` exists, however most of its properties are null.
