# ConnectApi.PlatformAction

A platform action instance with state information for the context user.

| Property Name | Type | Description | Available Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `actionUrl` | String | For action links of `subtype` `Ui` or `Download`, direct the user to download or visit the UI from this link. Salesforce issues a Javascript redirect for the link in this format: `/action-link-redirect/communityId​/actionLinkId?_bearer=bearerToken`.
For `Api` action links and for all platform actions, this value is `null` and Salesforce handles the call.

 | 33.0 |
| `apiName` | String | The API name. The value may be `null`. | 33.0 |
| `confirmation​Message` | String | If this action requires a confirmation and has a status of `NewStatus`, this is a default localized message that should be shown to an end user prior to invoking the action. Otherwise, this is `null`. | 33.0 |
| `executingUser` | `ConnectApi.UserSummary` | The user who initiated execution of this platform action. | 33.0 |
| `groupDefault` | Boolean | `true` if this platform action is the default or primary platform action in the platform action group; `false` otherwise. There can be only one default platform action per platform action group. | 33.0 |
| `iconUrl` | String | The URL of the icon for the platform action. This value may be `null`. | 33.0 |
| `id` | String | The ID for the platform action.

If the `type` is `QuickAction` and the `subtype` is `Create`, this value is `null`.

 | 33.0 |
| `label` | String | The localized label for this platform action. | 33.0 |
| `modifiedDate` | Datetime | ISO 8601 format date string, for example, 2011-02-25T18:24:31.000Z. | 33.0 |
| `platformAction​Group` | `ConnectApi.Reference` | A reference to the platform action group containing this platform action. | 33.0 |
| `status` | [`ConnectApi.​PlatformAction​Status`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/connectAPI_enums.htm#PlatformActionStatusEnum) | The execution status of the platform action. Values are:

-   `FailedStatus`—The action link execution failed.
-   `NewStatus`—The action link is ready to be executed. Available for `Download` and `Ui` action links only.
-   `PendingStatus`—The action link is executing. Choosing this value triggers the API call for `Api` and `ApiAsync` action links.
-   `SuccessfulStatus`—The action link executed successfully.

 | 33.0 |
| `subtype` | String | The subtype of a platform action or `null`.

If the `type` property is `ActionLink`, possible values are:

-   `Api`—The action link calls a synchronous API at the action URL. Salesforce sets the status to `SuccessfulStatus` or `FailedStatus` based on the HTTP status code returned by your server.
-   `ApiAsync`—The action link calls an asynchronous API at the action URL. The action remains in a `PendingStatus` state until a third party makes a request to `/connect/action-links/actionLinkId` to set the status to `SuccessfulStatus` or `FailedStatus` when the asynchronous operation is complete.
-   `Download`—The action link downloads a file from the action URL.
-   `Ui`—The action link takes the user to a web page at the action URL.

Invoking `ApiAsync` action links from an app requires a call to set the status. However, there isn’t currently a way to set the status of an action link using Apex. To set the status, use Connect REST API. See the Action Link resource in the [Connect REST API Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/ "HTML (New Window)")for more information.

 | 33.0 |
| `type` | [`ConnectApi.​PlatformActionType`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/connectAPI_enums.htm#PlatformActionTypeEnum) | The type of platform action. Values are:

-   `ActionLink`—An indicator on a feed element that targets an API, a web page, or a file, represented by a button in the Salesforce UI.
-   `CustomButton`—When clicked, opens a URL or a Visualforce page in a window or executes JavaScript.
-   `ProductivityAction`—Productivity actions are predefined and attached to a limited set of objects. Productivity actions include Send Email, Call, Map, View Website, and Read News. Except for the Call action, you can’t edit productivity actions.
-   `QuickAction`—A global or object-specific action.
-   `StandardButton`—A predefined Salesforce button such as New, Edit, or Delete.

 | 33.0 |
| `url` | String | The URL for this platform action.

If the `type` is `QuickAction` and the `subtype` is `Create`, this value is `null`.
