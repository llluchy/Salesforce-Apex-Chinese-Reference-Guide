# ConnectApi.Motif

The motif properties contain URLs for small, medium, and large icons that indicate the Salesforce record type. Common record types are files, users, and groups, but all record types have a set of motif icons. Custom object records use their tab style icon. All icons are available to unauthenticated users so that, for example, you can display the motif icons in an email. The motif can also contain the record type’s base color.

The motif images are icons, not user uploaded images or photos. For example, every user has the same set of motif icons.

Custom object records use their tab style icon, for example, the following custom object uses the “boat” tab style:

```plain
"motif": {
      "color: "8C004C",
      "largeIconUrl": "/img/icon/custom51_100/boat64.png",
      "mediumIconUrl": "/img/icon/custom51_100/boat32.png",
      "smallIconUrl": "/img/icon/custom51_100/boat16.png",
      "svgIconUrl": null
   },
```

Users use the following icons:

```plain
"motif": {
      "color: "1797C0",
      "largeIconUrl": "/img/icon/profile64.png",
      "mediumIconUrl": "/img/icon/profile32.png",
      "smallIconUrl": "/img/icon/profile16.png",
      "svgIconUrl": null
   },
```

Groups use the following icons:

```plain
"motif": {
      "color: "1797C0",
      "largeIconUrl": "/img/icon/groups64.png",
      "mediumIconUrl": "/img/icon/groups32.png",
      "smallIconUrl": "/img/icon/groups16.png",
      "svgIconUrl": null
   },
```

Files use the following icons:

```plain
"motif": {
      "color: "1797C0",
      "largeIconUrl": "/img/content/content64.png",
      "mediumIconUrl": "/img/content/content32.png",
      "smallIconUrl": "/img/icon/files16.png",
      "svgIconUrl": null
   },
```

:::tip Note
To view the icons in the previous examples, preface the URL with
                  https://instance_name. For example,
                  https://instance_name/img/icon/profile64.png.
