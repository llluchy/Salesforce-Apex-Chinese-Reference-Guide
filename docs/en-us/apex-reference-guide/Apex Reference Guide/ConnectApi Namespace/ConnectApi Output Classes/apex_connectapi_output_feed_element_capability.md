# ConnectApi.FeedElementCapability

A feed element capability, which defines the characteristics of a feed element.

In API version 30.0 and earlier, most feed items can have comments, likes, topics, and so on. In version 31.0 and later, every feed item (and feed element) can have a unique set of **capabilities**. If a capability property exists on a feed element, that capability is available, even if the capability property doesn’t have a value. For example, if the `ChatterLikes` capability property exists on a feed element (with or without a value), the context user can like that feed element. If the capability property doesn’t exist, it isn’t possible to like that feed element. A capability can also contain associated data. For example, the `Moderation` capability contains data about moderation flags.

This class is abstract.
