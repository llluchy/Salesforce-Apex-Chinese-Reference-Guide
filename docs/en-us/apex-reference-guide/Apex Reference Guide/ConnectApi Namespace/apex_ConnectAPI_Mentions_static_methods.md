Access information about mentions. A mention is an “@” character followed by a user or group name. When a user or group is mentioned, they receive a notification.

## Namespace

## Mentions Methods

These methods are for `Mentions`. All methods are static.

All methods in this class require Chatter and are subject to the per user, per namespace, per hour rate limit.
