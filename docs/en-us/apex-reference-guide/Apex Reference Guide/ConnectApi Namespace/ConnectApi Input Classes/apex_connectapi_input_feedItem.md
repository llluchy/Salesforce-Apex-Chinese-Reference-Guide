# ConnectApi.FeedItemInput

Used to create rich feed items, for example, feed items that include @mentions or files.

Subclass of [ConnectApi.FeedElementInput](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_connectapi_input_feed_element.htm "Feed elements are the top-level items that a feed contains. Feeds are feed element containers.") as of version 31.0.

| Property | Type | Description | Required or Optional | Available Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `attachment` | `ConnectApi.​Feed​Item​Attachment​​Input` | Specifies the attachment for the feed item. The feed item type is inferred based on the provided attachment. **Important:** As of API version 32.0, use the inherited `capabilities` property. | Optional | 28.0–31.0 |
| `body` | `ConnectApi.​Message​​Body​Input` | Message body. The body can contain up to 10,000 characters and 25 mentions. Because the character limit can change, clients should make a `describeSObjects()` call on the FeedItem or FeedComment object and look at the length of the Body or CommentBody field to determine the maximum number of allowed characters.
If you specify `originalFeedElementId` to share a feed item, use the `body` property to add the first comment to the feed item.

To edit this property in a feed item, use `updateFeedElement(communityId, feedElementId, feedElement)`. Editing feed posts is supported in version 34.0 and later.

 | Required unless the feed item has a link capability or a content capability. | 28.0 |
| `isBookmarked​​ByCurrentUser` | Boolean | Specifies if the new feed item should be bookmarked for the user (`true`) or not (`false`). **Important:** As of API version 32.0, use the `capabilities.bookmarks.isBookmarkedByCurrentUser` property. | Optional | 28.0–31.0 |
| `original​FeedElementId` | String | To share a feed element, specify its 18-character ID. **Important:** As of API version 39.0, use the `capabilities.feedEntity​Share.feedEntityId` property. | Optional | 31.0–38.0 |
| `original​FeedItemId` | String | To share a feed item, specify its 18-character ID. **Important:** In API version 32.0–38.0, use the `originalFeedElementId` property. In API version 39.0 and later, use the `capabilities.feedEntity​Share.feedEntityId` property. | Optional | 28.0–31.0 |
| `visibility` | [`ConnectApi.​FeedItem​VisibilityType`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/connectAPI_enums.htm#FeedItemTypeVisEnum) Enum | Type of users who can see a feed item.

-   `AllUsers`—Visibility is not limited to internal users.
-   `InternalUsers`—Visibility is limited to internal users.

Default values:

-   For external users, the default value is `AllUsers`. External users must use this value to see their posts.
-   For internal users, the default value is `InternalUsers`. Internal users can accept this value or use the value `AllUsers` to allow external users to see their posts.

If the parent of the feed item is a user, group, or direct message, the `visibility` of the feed item must be `AllUsers`.

 | Optional | 28.0 |
