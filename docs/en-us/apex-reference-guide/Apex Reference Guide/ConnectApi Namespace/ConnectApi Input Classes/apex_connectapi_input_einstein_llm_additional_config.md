Additional configuration information for the LLM provider.

| Property | Type | Description | Required or Optional | Available Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `additional​Parameters` | [Map](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_map.htm#apex_methods_system_map "Contains methods for the Map collection type.")<String, `ConnectApi.​WrappedValue`\> | Map of parameters and values for the LLM provider. | Optional | 60.0 |
| `application​Name` | String | Name of the application. | Required | 60.0 |
| `enable​PiiMasking` | Boolean | Specifies whether to mask personally identifiable information (PII) (`true`) or not (`false`). | Optional | 60.0 |
| `frequency​Penalty` | Double | Use to reduce the repetitiveness of generated tokens. The higher the value, the stronger a penalty is applied to previously present tokens, proportional to how many times they already appeared in the prompt or in prior generations. Minimum value is `0.0`. Maximum value is `1.0`. | Optional | 60.0 |
| `maxTokens` | Integer | Maximum number of tokens to generate. | Optional | 60.0 |
| `num​Generations` | Integer | Number of generation requests to send to the LLM provider. | Optional | 60.0 |
| `presence​Penalty` | Double | Use to reduce the repetitiveness of generated tokens. This value is similar to frequency penalty, except that this penalty is applied equally to all tokens that already appeared, regardless of their exact frequencies. Minimum value is `0.0`, and maximum value is `1.0`. | Optional | 60.0 |
| `stopSequences` | [List](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_list.htm#apex_methods_system_list "Contains methods for the List collection type.")<String> | Generated text is cut at the end of the earliest occurrence of a stop sequence. | Optional | 60.0 |
| `temperature` | Double | Sampling temperature to use. Higher values mean the model takes more risks. Lower temperatures mean that generations are less random. Minimum value is `0.0`, and maximum value is `1.0` | Optional | 60.0 |
