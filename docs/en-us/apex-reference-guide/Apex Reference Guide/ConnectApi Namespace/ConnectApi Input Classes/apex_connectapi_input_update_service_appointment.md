# ConnectApi.UpdateServiceAppointmentInput

Contains information to update a service appointment.

| Property | Type | Description | Required or Optional | Available Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `serviceAppointmentId` | String | The ID of the service appointment to be modified. | Required | 53.0 |
| `assignedResources` | [List](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_list.htm#apex_methods_system_list "Contains methods for the List collection type.")<`ConnectApi.AssignedResourcesInput`\> | Represents the service resources who are assigned to a service appointment.
When updating an appointment, pass the complete list of required resources. If you don’t pass a resource who is already assigned to the appointment, the API deletes that assigned resource. For example, suppose that an existing service appointment has assigned resources: A and B and you pass B and C in assigned resources in the PATCH request. The API checks the resource availability of B and C for existing work type and service territory, and if both are available, the service appointment gets updated with:

-   Resource A—Deleted
-   ResourceB—Updated
-   ResourceC—Created

However, if you don’t pass any of the assigned resources, the API assumes there’s no change.

When creating an appointment, use `extendedFields` to add values to any of the fields, including custom fields, in `assignedResources` as long as you have edit access to those fields. | Optional | 53.0 |
