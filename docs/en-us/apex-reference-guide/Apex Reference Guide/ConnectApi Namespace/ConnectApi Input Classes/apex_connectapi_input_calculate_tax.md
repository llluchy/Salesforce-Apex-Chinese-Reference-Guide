Subclass of [ConnectApi.TaxTransactionRequest](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_connectapi_input_tax_transaction.htm "Information about the tax transaction sent to the tax adapter as part of a tax calculation request.").

| Property | Type | Description | Required or Optional | Available Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isCommit` | Boolean | Commits the transaction for tax calculation. | Required | 55.0 |
| `isHeaderTaxRequested` | Boolean | Indicates whether header tax is enabled in the tax engine (`true`) or not (`false`). | Optional | 66.0 |
| `shouldVoidTax` | Boolean | 
Indicates whether to void the tax transaction associated with a document that's mentioned as the `referenceDocumentCode` property value with `taxType`property value as `Actual` and `isCommit` property value set to `true`.

Keep these considerations in mind when you use this property.

-   If the `shouldVoidTax` property value is set to `true`, then the operation returns a response with `documentCode` property value updated to `referenceDocumentCode` property value that was originally sent in the request payload. The response also includes the `taxTransactionType` property value as `Void`. This indicates that the document specified in the `referenceDocumentCode` property value is voided.
-   If document is locked or you can't void the tax transaction for any reason, then you can use the Tax Calculation request to perform another transaction such as a Credit Tax request. In this scenario, the response includes the `documentCode` property value that was sent in the request payload.
-   If the document that's mentioned in the `referenceDocumentCode` property value isn't available in the tax engine, then an error response occurs with [ResultCode](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_enum_commercetax_ResultCode.htm "Code that represents the results of a tax request made to the tax engine.") value as `ReferenceDocumentCodeMissing`.
