# Canvas Exceptions

The `Canvas` namespace contains exception classes.

All exception classes support built-in methods for returning the error message and exception type. See [Exception Class and Built-In Exceptions](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_classes_exception_methods.htm "An exception denotes an error that disrupts the normal flow of code execution. You can use Apex built-in exceptions or create custom exceptions. All exceptions have common methods.").

The `Canvas` namespace contains this exception:

| Exception | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Canvas.CanvasRenderException` | Use this class in your implementation of [Canvas.CanvasLifecycleHandler.`onRender(renderContext)`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_canvas_CanvasLifecycleHandler_onRender.htm "Invoked when a canvas app is rendered. Provides the ability to set and retrieve canvas application and environment context information during the application render phase."). To show an error to the user in your `onRender()` implementation, throw a `Canvas.CanvasRenderException`, and the canvas framework will render the error message to the user.  This exception will be managed only within the `onRender()` method. |

## Example

The following example implementation of `onRender()` catches a CanvasException that was thrown because a canvas URL was set with a string that exceeded the maximum length. A CanvasRenderException is created and thrown to display the error to the user.

```apex
public class MyCanvasListener 
implements Canvas.CanvasLifecycleHandler {
    
    public void onRender(Canvas.RenderContext renderContext) {
        Canvas.ApplicationContext app = renderContext.getApplicationContext();

        // Code to generate a URL string that is too long

        // ...

        // Try to set the canvas app URL using the invalid URL string
        try {
            app.setCanvasUrlPath(aUrlPathThatIsTooLong);
        } catch (CanvasException e) {
            // Display error to user by throwing a new CanvasRenderException
            throw new Canvas.CanvasRenderException(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
