# Test Constants

The Test class provides constants that are used as keys when you set mock application and environment context data.

When you call [Canvas.Test.`mockRenderContext(applicationContextTestValues, environmentContextTestValues)`](atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_canvas_Test_mockRenderContext.htm "Creates and returns a test Canvas.RenderContext based on the provided application and environment context parameters."), you need to provide maps of key-value pairs to represent your mock application and environment context data. The Test class provides static constant strings that you can use as keys for various parts of the application and environment context.
